<p class="title">Chapter 1: Guide to the Unusual (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">I quite enjoy the library.<br><br>I don't have to worry about what other people say or how<br>they look at me—I can devote myself wholly to the quiet<br>hours.<br><br>As usual, I get to school before the start of class and<br>study here.<br><br>It's anything but a usual day, however. Today's the culture<br>festival, and excitement is buzzing throughout the entire<br>school.<br><br>A huge sign stands outside the school gates welcoming<br>visitors from outside, and dozens of colorful stalls line<br>the campus on the other side. My class's stall is presumably<br>among them, but I don't drop by to check on it. I study in<br>the library instead.<br><br>The familiar classmates I pass don't say anything. I know<br>they don't expect any sort of help from me.<br><br>It's only been a few months since I started high school,<br>and I'm out of place in my class.<br><br>I have my aspirations, and dealing with others is too much<br>of a bother. I don't have time to sing praises of my school<br>life like other students, nor do I want to.<br><br>The <i>bang, bang!</i> of blank shots reaches the library.<br><br>And here I thought I could concentrate on my studies during<br>the culture festival... My concentration broken, I stare out<br>at the blue sky beyond the windows.<br><br>"Seriously? <i>This</i> is where you've been?" It's a<br>sudden, blunt voice that hardly suits the air of this place. <br><br><i>Oh no—she found me.</i><br><br>The voice belongs to a girl in my grade who's a bit out of<br>place for a prep school like this—she has bright blonde hair<br>and never wears her uniform properly.<br><br>She always behaves terribly, and everyone else thinks of her<br>as a delinquent.<br><br>She stands out for different reasons in class, and for<br>whatever reason, she occasionally pokes her nose into<br>my business.<br><br>She has the audacity to sit across from me, cackles, and<br>says thoughtlessly, "It's so funny you're studying today,<br>of all days."<br><br>In a wordless display to show how busy I am, I drop my eyes<br>back to my books and ignore her.<br><br>But that is never enough to discourage the blonde girl, and<br>I always lose out in the end. Unfortunately, today is no<br>exception.<br><br>I ask her what she wants, and she says, "Since you clearly<br>have nothing better to do, we should go check out the<br>festival together."<br><br>What? She wants to go? With <i>me</i>?<br><br>Her usual stubbornness rears its ugly head. Eventually, she<br>grabs my phone from the table and yells, "Follow me if you<br>want it back!" She races out of the library.<br><br>Now that things have gotten this far, calming her down would<br>be way more trouble than it's worth...<br><br>And so I agree to look around with her, on the condition<br>that it's for "a little bit." It is a calculated move,<br>knowing I'll be freed more quickly that way.<br><br>I avoided the blonde girl at first. Her loud appearance<br>and flippant personality were alien to me.<br><br>But in these few months since starting school, she has been<br>the only one who has talked to me with any regularity<br>despite my cold exterior.<br><br>And the more I get to know about her family life and inner<br>world from our occasional conversations, the more I see<br>her in a different light.<br><br>She's loud, quite a handful, and, to be blunt, a constant<br>interruption to my studies. But I can't bring myself to<br>dislike her...<br><br>I walk along the school halls, brightly decorated with<br>balloons, paper decorations, and painted signs, with the<br>excited blonde girl.<br><br>Now that I get a better look at the school, I realize the<br>whole building has a particular air—families with cotton<br>candy wander around, and performers in costumes strut<br>through the halls. While preparing for the festival, I avoided<br>all work besides the bare minimum assigned to me, so I'm<br>surprised to see it so thoroughly decorated in such a<br>short period.<br><br>She scarcely pays me any mind as she pulls me by the arm and<br>drags me into a classroom with a sign written over it<br>reading "SHOOTING GALLERY."<br><br>Excitable students greet us like eager employees at a store<br>and hand us "handguns" made of disposable chopsticks.<br><br>I stand bewildered, and they say we can pay one hundred yen<br>for five shots as they hand us a rubber band.<br><br>While I slowly set the rubber band in place, I hear the<br>clanging of a bell. I turn to my side to see the girl<br>standing victorious. She scoops up the small stuffed rabbit<br>she managed to shoot down, sets her next band, and aims<br>at her next target.<br><br>Undaunted, I also aim at the target... But embarrassingly,<br>the band flies into next week.<br><br>I have one shot left. I aim carefully, determined to make<br>this shot count. I notice the girl looking at me as she puts<br>her prizes into a bag.<br><br>I know she's making fun of me internally.<br><br>But when she grasps my situation, she gives me surprisingly<br>succinct advice. She does so gently, politely, in a way that<br>doesn't harm my masculine pride. And it...somehow reminds<br>me of someone I know.<br><br>Perhaps my blonde classmate is the older sister of a much<br>younger sibling. That would explain her sisterly care.<br><br>Taking her advice, I hold up my chopstick gun one more time.<br>The moment of truth... But things are often easier said than<br>done. My rubber band skims the side of a box of sweets, and<br>that's that.<br><br>"Close!" she says with a grin, then tosses me a box of<br>caramel candy from her bag. By the time I catch it, she's<br>already moving on to the next classroom.<br><br>"C'mon!"<br><br>Her voice is comfortable and familiar, as though we've been<br>friends for a long time. And afterward, we go around to each<br>classroom together.<br><br>I win the quiz competition, we split the takoyaki she<br>craved, and each time, she smiles kindly at me.<br><br>Though pangs of guilt stir in my chest from neglecting my<br>studies, it wasn't half as bad a time as I imagined.<br><br>Once we had seen the majority of the displays and stalls,<br>the sun was beginning to set. I tell my blonde classmate<br>that I will be returning to the library shortly.<br><br>She then tells me she wants to see the grand finale of the<br>culture festival: the fireworks display.<br><br>It's said that this school has fireworks every year. She is<br>more excited about this than I anticipated, taking me to an<br>empty classroom with a perfect view of the fireworks.<br><br>The moment we get to the classroom, she runs to the<br>restroom. She'd been having so much fun that she kept<br>missing her chance to go—I can't help but chuckle.<br><br>Though I agreed to accompany her for only a little bit, when<br>I look at the clock on the classroom wall, I see how late<br>it's gotten...<br><br>I don't handle noise well, not to mention letting others<br>mind me, but...today was hardly a bad day.<br><br>Just after she rushes back from the restroom, what follows<br>is a brilliant display in the sky that never lets things go<br>completely dark.<br><br>Several modest fireworks burst in the sky. Though we are<br>somewhat disappointed, it's the perfect cherry on top for<br>the first day of the cultural festival.<br><br>"Hey, sorry for bothering you while you were studying," she<br>says quietly.<br><br>But I respond with a whisper of my own, "I mean, it wasn't<br>so bad in the end..."<br><br>As we share our thoughts on the festival, watching the other<br>students clean the grounds, a sudden announcement comes<br>over the intercom.<br><br>It's specifically calling for our class to gather in the<br>classroom.<br><br>"I guess we should go..." We can't ignore this one, so we<br>leave the empty classroom behind.<br><br>Feeling awkward that I avoided helping set up in the<br>morning, I enter the classroom and join my classmates,<br>wearing their matching class T-shirts and bracelets.<br><br>Some students look anxious, while others hang their heads<br>in what looks like anger—quite the contrast to their colorful<br>clothing. And yet, our homeroom teacher starts off in a calm<br>tone.<br><br>"We're missing a part of the sales from our crepe stall."<br><br>At that moment, whispers ripple through the classroom. The<br>teacher calms the class and begins to explain what happened. <br><br>Our class was situated outside, running a crepe stand. As<br>a way to prevent others from stealing the money, any money<br>collected from sales would be brought to the safe in the<br>classroom at specific times.<br><br>Part of that money vanished while it was being moved from<br>the stand to the classroom...<br><br>Though our teacher did not explicitly say it was stolen,<br>the implication was that someone took the money.<br><br>"No way... Who could've done this?"<br><br>"We worked so hard to make that money..."<br><br>"It's gotta be someone else from another class..."<br><br>As the entire class reels from the revelation, I cannot help<br>but voice the words bouncing around in my head.<br><br>"The culprit is in this class..."<br><br>And the next thing I know, everyone is looking at me.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Who Ruined the Culture Festival (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">The first day of my high school culture festival came to<br>a close.<br><br>The entire class gathers in our classroom, and our homeroom<br>teacher informs us that part of the proceeds from our stall<br>has vanished.<br><br>When I hear the details, I’m convinced it is theft and that<br>someone in this class committed it...<br><br>“The culprit is in this class...”<br><br>The words spill out of my mouth before I realize it,<br>bringing suspicion and panic to my classmates.<br>My teacher desperately tries to calm the reeling class.<br><br>The teacher then asks me, his tone agitated for reasons<br>I don’t understand, “Do you have proof?”<br><br>I begin to sort out the situation in my mind as I answer.<br><br>First, my class was running a crepe stall. And twice in the<br>day at specific times—once around noon and once around<br>sunset—a specific student was supposed to bring it to the<br>classroom safe for safekeeping.<br><br>According to the teacher, the money was collected and<br>vanished on the way to the classroom.<br><br>The details of how and when the money would be collected<br>were posted in the class group chat that morning. Only those<br>in the class know about the money.<br><br>There’s a chance that someone outside of the class caught<br>wind of the information somewhere during the festival, but it’s<br>unlikely they would ever have the chance to plot the theft.<br><br>“So you’re saying <i>we</i> stole it?” <br><br>One of the two students in charge of safekeeping the sales<br>shouts.<br><br>“That’s not what I’m saying. If anything, you are immediately<br>exempt from suspicion.” Their face is red from the tension,<br>but I ignore them and continue to think. “At which collection<br>phase did the proceeds go missing, anyway?”<br><br>“The second phase. Isn’t that right?” the teacher turns to<br>the student who was at the stall at the time of the second<br>collection.<br><br>According to the student’s testimony, someone dressed in a<br>bunny costume came at the evening collection time, and she<br>mistook them for the student in charge of the collection.<br><br>Feeling partially responsible for the incident, the student<br>wears a glum look but makes an addendum as she recalls<br>the situation.<br><br>Despite her suspicion when she saw the costume, this person<br>was holding their class-specific collections box, so she ultimately<br>concluded that they were the classmate in charge of collecting<br>the money.<br><br>Once the person in the costume left, the real student in<br>charge of the money came, and chaos befell the stall.<br><br>When the teacher went to check on the money in the classroom<br>safe, he found only the proceeds from noon, and though they<br>split up to look for the missing money, they have yet to<br>find it...<br><br><i>I knew it</i>, I think to myself. The culprit was well-<br>informed about how the money was handled.<br><br>My classmates begin to stir again, each of them hoping to<br>escape suspicion.<br><br>Among the chatter, my ears pick up on someone saying,<br>“...is suspicious.”<br><br>“Yeah, I heard she has sticky fingers...”<br><br><i>She</i> is the blonde girl I walked around the culture<br>festival with, the one the whole rest of the class treats<br>like a criminal.<br><br>And the moment that whisper reaches the ears of others,<br>the entire classroom tacitly comes together.<br><br>They want to frame the ill-mannered blonde girl as the<br>culprit.<br><br>At this point, the entire class begins to cross-examine her<br>to make her the scapegoat.<br><br>“We bonded to make this culture festival a reality. The<br>only one who could do something so awful is someone who<br>doesn’t help!”<br><br>“I heard she stole money from her job too. Once a thief,<br>always a thief!”<br><br>“She never came to run the stall—she was too busy plotting<br>her crime all day!”<br><br>It’s all illogical nonsense, spoken from a place of self-<br>preservation.<br><br>I point out the fallacies with each of their testimonies<br>and prove her innocence.<br><br>It is clear that the reason they all doubt her comes from<br>a place of prejudice due to how she dresses and looks,<br>as well as the flippancy of her words and actions.<br><br>And just as I begin to tire of the futile arguments,<br>I present to them a perfect alibi.<br><br>According to the testimony of the students in charge of the<br>money, the crime took place shortly before five o’clock. She<br>and I had gone to the empty classroom to watch the fireworks<br>about thirty minutes later.<br><br>That means that when the proceeds were stolen, she and<br>I were still in the middle of looking around the festival.<br>Some try to argue that we are co-conspirators, but the<br>students whose booths we visited would be able to provide<br>testimony.<br><br>“You mean to tell me that she’s the culprit, but I believe<br>someone else fits the bill much more neatly.”<br><br>My coup de grace of a statement causes everyone in class<br>to fall silent—they have nothing to say in return.<br><br>A light clap breaks the silence, one that hardly fits the<br>gravity of the situation. In concert, the teacher showers<br>me with praise.<br><br>“Wow, I’m impressed! You’re just like a detective in<br>a mystery novel!”<br><br>Our teacher often spoke about mystery novels with fervor,<br>even during class, and the students consider him quite<br>eccentric.<br><br>Everyone’s eyes go wide. For a moment, I don’t understand<br>what he means.<br><br>The teacher, who has been watching silently this whole time,<br>speaks as though he is urging us to go home. He says he will<br>be looking after the classroom safe tomorrow, so we can rest<br>easy and enjoy day two of the festival as we please.<br><br>He then turns to me and the blonde girl and says, with<br>a twinkle in his eye, “If you’re the detective in this whodunit,<br>then that would make her your sidekick.”<br><br>“Solve the mystery of who stole our proceeds together.”<br>That is the task the teacher has entrusted to us.<br><br>We have a time limit: by the end of school the following<br>day—by the time the second and final day of the culture<br>festival is over.<br><br>“Cooperation, everyone!”<br><br>The first day of the culture festival comes to a strange<br>end, thanks to our mystery-loving homeroom teacher.<br><br>As the other students make their way home, they regard<br>me suspiciously or with glares.<br><br>What a fine mess this whole thing is. All I wanted to do was<br>study...<br><br>The blonde girl and I are the only ones left in the<br>classroom. We exchange wordless stares.<br><br>Still...I haven’t had a day like this in some time—a day<br>where everyone is frightfully aware of my existence...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Inconvenient Glint (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">Day two of the high school culture festival.<br><br>Purely by chance, I happened to get wrapped up in the<br>search for the culprit who committed theft in my class.<br><br>Just as the first day was about to come to an end,<br>someone stole the proceeds from our class stall.<br><br>The girl I had gone around the festival with was named<br>as a potential suspect.<br><br>Why? Elementary.<br><br>She dyed her hair blonde, and she wore loud, gaudy clothing.<br>She was poorly behaved in our typical day-to-day at school.<br>That was all the reason her accusers needed.<br><br>The entire class was determined to peg her as the criminal<br>baselessly, but I refuted their misplaced statements.<br><br>Our homeroom teacher cheered me on, insisting I was like the<br>detective in a mystery novel. He instructed me to search for<br>the true culprit by the end of the second day, with the girl<br>as my assistant.<br><br>And so, my blonde sidekick and I walk the school grounds<br>together.<br><br>I glance aside to see her with candy in her mouth,<br>listlessly looking around the area.<br><br>In a way, I understand. The way our classmates focused fire<br>on her yesterday must have stung pretty badly.<br><br>"First, we should retrace the Bunny Costume's steps..."<br><br>"Bunny Costume" is my nickname for the culprit who stole<br>the money during collection time. They appeared shortly<br>before the class's agreed collection time, took all the<br>money in the specific box meant for collection, and then<br>vanished.<br><br>If we can get a general grasp of their actions, we might<br>be able to find some sort of lead. First, we will have to<br>question our classmates.<br><br>Talking to classmates I barely spoke to in the first place<br>is, quite honestly, a huge challenge.<br><br>Some of them are clearly wary of the girl beside me.<br><br>But whenever I'm unsure of how to talk to them, the blonde<br>girl always supports me or speaks in my stead.<br><br>Many misunderstand her due to her looks or the way she talks<br>and acts, but she is caring and quite skilled at helping others<br>in a casual manner.<br><br>Whenever I look at her, I can't help but be reminded of<br>someone...<br><br>If I recall correctly, she only has one parent and younger<br>siblings. I suppose that would explain her sisterly<br>demeanor.<br><br>As those thoughts roll around in my mind, she suddenly<br>speaks to me. "Hey...thanks," she says.<br><br>I turn around, and she continues to speak. She says that<br>when everyone suspected her yesterday, she was afraid<br>they would start suspecting me too.<br><br>But she was delighted that I came to her defense instead<br>of suspecting her.<br><br>"All I did was say what I thought was right."<br><br>"And that made me happy."<br><br>She thanks me again. I can't see the look on her face very<br>well.<br><br>Nobody in our class who was working at the stall the day<br>prior seems to know where the bunny came from or where<br>it vanished to.<br><br>Even as the sun sets, we have no leads. So, with the girl<br>in tow, I widen our scope and begin to question the classes<br>with stalls near ours.<br><br>It's here that I hear something strange.<br><br>"That was right before the fireworks rehearsal, right?<br>Everyone was busy breaking down their stalls, so no one<br>would have noticed then."<br><br>Rehearsal?<br><br>I repeat this word, and the student I'm talking to points<br>to the poster plastered on the nearby wall.<br><br>"Today's the <i>real</i> show. The rehearsal was yesterday.<br>Pretty sweet for a trial run, though, wasn't it?"<br><br>The poster details the time and date of the fireworks show.<br>It's tonight...and starts later than the one the day before.<br><br>Standing still in front of the poster, the blonde girl<br>approaches me from behind.<br><br>"Oh, huh. The fireworks are today!"<br><br>Her tone is unnaturally bright.<br><br>Yesterday, she had dragged me to the empty classroom,<br>stressing how desperate she was to see beautiful fireworks.<br><br>If the rehearsal was yesterday and today is the real show,<br>then that makes her actions a bit odd.<br><br>"Hey, we should see the fireworks again as a do-over!"<br><br>I can sense the trouble in her voice, and it's clear that<br>her smile is forced. I almost want to refuse the conclusion<br>I come to in my head.<br><br>But...I cannot do that.<br><br>"All right..."<br><br>I fall in step behind her as she walks lightly, almost<br>delighted, just as I did the day before. My own steps are<br>heavy, and our attitudes could hardly be any more different.<br><br>Funnily enough, we arrive at the classroom at around the<br>same time we did yesterday.<br><br>But unlike yesterday, the cheers coming from outside feel<br>empty, and the ticking of the clock echoes loudly in my ears.<br><br>I'm the first to break the silence.<br><br>"I solved the mystery," I say, but the girl does not turn to<br>look at me. Her gaze remains fixed outside. And so, I<br>continue, "You used me for an alibi. You are the culprit."<br><br>After a lengthy silence, the blonde girl finally replies.<br><br>"...Do you have proof?"<br><br>I have no way of knowing what she's thinking. I take out my<br>phone, and with an exhausted voice, I reply.<br><br>"The clock in this classroom is thirty minutes fast. It's<br>not something one is likely to notice if they're not paying<br>attention. I was surprised. That's why you took my phone,<br>isn't it?"<br><br>The girl turns to look at me. And though there is spite in<br>her eyes, she has a smile on her face.<br><br>The moment she brought me to this classroom—or, to be more<br>precise, the moment I had been chosen to look for the<br>culprit—she had been ready for this.<br><br>"Hold on a sec," she says and leaves the classroom.<br><br>I do not give chase.<br><br>For some reason, I can't imagine her running away.<br>And just as I suspect, she comes back.<br><br>In her hands, she holds the box for collecting the class<br>proceeds.<br><br>In the box is an envelope with bills and coins.<br><br>"You're right. I stole it. I hid the money and the costume<br>in another empty classroom."<br><br>Here's how she committed the crime.<br><br>First, she invited me to the festival so she could have<br>someone to affirm her alibi. She then took my phone<br>so I wouldn't know the time.<br><br>Then, she took me to an empty classroom with a clock thirty<br>minutes fast so she could leave me and commit the crime. She<br>told me she was going to the restroom and instead stole the<br>collected money.<br><br>Afterward, she went to a different empty classroom to hide<br>the costume and the money, then returned to me as though<br>nothing had happened, and then we watched the fireworks<br>rehearsal together.<br><br>She put her plan together in the morning when the collection<br>information came through to the class chat, and then she<br>actually went through with it. And that shocked me.<br><br>Her grades are poor because she doesn't come to class, and<br>the class treats her like a nuisance. But deep down...she<br>isn't like that. A strange thought comes to me—if she were<br>under pressure, would that explain her actions?<br><br>Whatever the case, I'm gravely disappointed because I had<br>such a pleasant time with her yesterday.<br><br>Something else strikes me as strange.<br><br>The class proceeds aren't much, in truth. And the portion<br>she stole was only half a day's worth. No matter how I think<br>about it, it doesn't seem worth the effort to me.<br><br>She understands my intentions from my gaze. Her expression<br>twists.<br><br>"I didn't have a choice..." she murmurs weakly.<br><br>The first burst of the fireworks illuminates her face.<br><br>A streak of tears runs down her cheek.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Return to Reality (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">From the dim, empty classroom, I watch the first firework<br>of the show bloom brilliantly in the sky.<br><br>I glance at my phone—it started at the time mentioned on<br>the flier. But according to the clock in the classroom, it's<br>beginning thirty minutes late.<br><br>With surprising—and disappointing—ease, the blonde girl<br>confesses that she was the one who stole the money from<br>our class stall.<br><br>And...<br><br>"I didn't know what else to do... We're broke. We never have<br>enough money."<br><br>They're always a few hundred yen short of replacing her<br>little brother's tattered shoes... They can barely afford to<br>pay to send him on field trips... She is keenly, agonizingly<br>aware of how the other kids perceive her little sister when<br>she goes to her sports festival...<br><br>"That's why I cut down on school hours and worked instead.<br>But they said the money in the register didn't match up with<br>the records, so they blamed me, and guess who got fired?"<br><br>She didn't want to dress in a way that showed she was poor,<br>so she dressed herself up like any other girl her age,<br>within the means she had. But her cheap accessories often<br>came off as gaudy and vulgar.<br><br>Never did I think things would lead to this, though.<br><br>Not only that, but the small expenses of day-to-day life<br>were mercilessly pushing her family further into a corner.<br><br>"If it were just me and my dad, that would be one thing. But<br>my little brother and sister... And people <i>still</i> suspect<br>me even if I'm not doing anything."<br><br>I have no words. Though I had an inkling of what was going<br>on at home, I had no idea things were this desperate for her.<br><br>"What...should I have done?"<br><br>This girl sacrifices pieces of herself and even steals for<br>her little siblings. A painful weight settles on me when<br>I think of my own self-sacrificing older sister.<br><br>The fireworks glow brightly over her pain. I look her<br>straight in the eye.<br><br>"Let's go to the teacher."<br><br>We will be honest, and we will apologize to our classmates.<br>She may have to explain her situation to them if it comes to<br>it. But this is something we must do.<br><br>"I'll...do what I can to help you with money," I say.<br><br>She looks at me with surprise but tears well in her eyes as<br>a smile crosses her face, and she nods.<br><br>Together, we make our way to the staff room and to our<br>homeroom teacher, lover of whodunits, the eccentric who<br>made me the detective in this case.<br><br>When we return the money and tell him what happened,<br>the blonde girl offers a tearful apology. But...<br><br>"What a remarkable trick, though... If this were a mystery<br>novel, you'd be like a real detective!" he says cheerfully<br>as he counts the money and ensures that it matches the<br>records.<br><br>He doesn't seem like he's scolding her, nor does he ask why<br>she did it.<br><br>"So you stole on a whim, and you just happened to succeed.<br>Don't do it again, got it?"<br><br>"Er, not exactly. She planned it because of what's going<br>on at—"<br><br>I begin babbling in a panic, but the teacher raises<br>a finger, signaling me to be quiet.<br><br>"Listen. The collection plan was posted to the chat that morning.<br>There's no way you could have carried out something so<br>elaborate the same day." He then shakes his head. "This<br>is a prep school. If word about this became public, it would<br>be a disgrace. You confessed, so we're going to keep this<br>just between us, okay?"<br><br>He smiles. On his desk is a small stack of famous mystery<br>novels.<br><br>I glance aside. The blonde girl, her gaze cast downward,<br>says quietly, "Okay."<br><br>"Didn't you want everyone to know the truth, though?" I ask.<br>"Isn't that why you made me investigate?"<br><br>My voice cracks, and my fists quiver. I can't immediately<br>identify the emotion that wells in me.<br><br>"Maybe in the world of stories, sure. But reality isn't so<br>cut and dry. I think you'll understand that as you grow up..."<br><br>I can no longer stand it. I turn my back on my teacher<br>and do not hear the rest of what he has to say.<br><br>On the way back to the classroom, I hear the cheerful sounds<br>of the other students wrapping up the cultural festival.<br><br>Yet the blonde girl, her head still drooped, murmurs<br>quietly.<br><br>"I don't really matter, do I? Even if I don't do something,<br>people accuse me. And if I do something, it's treated like<br>nothing ever happened... It's like I'm just a convenient<br>excuse."<br><br>Self-deprecation sits heavily in her voice.<br><br>I want to say something, but in the end, I could not.<br><br>Once the culture festival comes to an end, the colorful<br>decorations are taken down, and we return to our regular<br>school life.<br><br>I come to school a little earlier in the morning than the<br>other students and study in the library. After school, I leaf<br>through reference documents in the library until it's time<br>for me to go to work.<br><br>I never spoke to her again.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: A Candid Chat (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">Mama: Yuzuki seems aloof and hard to approach at first,<br>but he's such a good boy deep down!<br><br>Mama: You have <i>no</i> idea how happy I was when he<br>looked for me after I got lost in The Cage!<br><br>Babe: The kid's surprisingly clingy. Did you see how<br>relieved he looked when he found you?<br><br>Mama: Hee hee! Oh, and do you remember what he said?<br>"What good is a guide that keeps getting lost?"<br>Remember!?<br><br>Babe: That imitation was perfect, Mumsie.<br>Even better than the real thing.<br><br>Yuzuki: Hey, uh... What are you talking about?<br><br>Mama: Oh, we were just discussing the things we love<br>about our little Yu!<br><br>Yuzuki: Well, please stop with the—<br><br>Mama: Oh, I know! Now it's YOUR turn to say what you<br>like about the two of US! Doesn't that sound nice?<br><br>Yuzuki: Um... Well, I guess I... Whnn... Whnnnnn...<br><br>Mama: Um, Yu? Are you trying to get out of<br>this assignment by whistling?<br><br>Babe: Bwaaa ha ha! The kid can't whistle!<br><br>Yuzuki: No! I just...made a mistake. That's all.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: Stage of Dreams (No.06)</p>
<p class="para">Gloaming turns to night, settling over the room like a <br>shroud. The only sound is the steady ticking of a clock.<br>The boy, exhausted from work and study, throws himself<br>onto his bed. He lies there, staring listlessly at the ceiling,<br>and lets his imagination wander.<br><br>The ceiling quickly becomes a night sky⁠ aglow with stars.<br>He draws lines and creates various constellations: A book.<br>A camera. A violet. The boy creates these things from the<br>imaginary points of light on his ceiling, filling his mind with<br>as much joy as he can before sleep comes to claim him.<br><br><i>He's alone again today.</i><br><br>An unpleasant noise echoes in the back of his mind: words<br>that were spoken about him at school. As he remembers them,<br>the constellations on the ceiling shudder and wink out. <br><br>His manager yelling at him. University students laughing as<br>he bumped into them on the street. Every time a memory of<br>the day replays in his mind, another imaginary star is<br>snuffed out. Soon, all that remains is a ceiling of perfect<br>black. The boy covers his ears and squeezes his eyes shut,<br>ready to escape into sleep—his single reprieve from reality.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 7: Museum of Bonds (No.07)</p>
<p class="para">The young boy went to the museum with his mother and sister.<br><br>They saw a model of the solar system's planets hung from<br>the ceiling and an exhibit with dinosaur fossils on display—<br>the boy was fascinated. He wanted to show off everything<br>he'd learned from his encyclopedia, so he began to explain<br>what he saw. As he watched his mother nod with a smile,<br>he beamed and only grew more enthusiastic.<br><br>"I beg your pardon, but please keep your voice down..."<br>The sudden voice belonged to a museum employee.<br>The warning startled and embarrassed the boy,<br>who looked upon the rest of the displays in complete<br>silence. His brief joy felt like fragments of a distant<br>dream, now replaced with cold darkness.<br><br>Evening fell, and after a brief visit to the gift shop, they<br>headed home. That's when the sad boy's sister handed<br>him a keychain of his favorite planet, Pluto—he just liked<br>how the name sounded. "We'll come back sometime,"<br>she said, her smile like the sun's rays, warming his heart<br>and reaching the very edges of the solar system.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 8: Pair of Self-Reproach (No.08)</p>
<p class="para">When the boy was in middle school, his family started<br>slowly falling apart. His mother took on loads of debt,<br>and his father became more violent in actions and<br>speech regarding the prospect of repayment.<br><br>As the cracks in their family grew, it was the boy's sister<br>alone who didn't give up and kept on smiling. "I bet she<br>could put our family back together," he thought, using his<br>respect as a shield from the painful reality.<br><br>One day, the boy arrived home straight from school<br>and heard a voice coming from the bathroom.<br>The rest of the family should have been at work or<br>school clubs. He peeked through the crack in the door<br>to find his sister sobbing, doing her absolute best to<br>do so in silence. Gripped in her hand was a brush<br>with a shocking amount of her hair caught in the<br>bristles. In the sink, too, was a mat of her hair.<br><br>The boy felt a sharp twist in his chest, and he couldn't<br>breathe. His sister alone was shouldering the pressure<br>of keeping their family together. The boy cursed his<br>cowardice for looking away from this reality as he locked<br>himself in his room, blaming himself for this for the nights to<br>come. He could not let his sister shoulder this burden alone.<br>He would never admit weakness in her presence again.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 9: Harmonies of Surrender (No.09)</p>
<p class="para">When the boy was very young, he and his family went to stay<br>with his maternal grandparents over summer vacation. They<br>lived in a big house in an affluent neighborhood outside the<br>city. Sitting in the large living room was a beautiful grand<br>piano, the kind he might find in his school’s music room.<br><br>The boy’s older sister greeted it like an old friend and<br>cast aside the red felt covering the keys. Her pale, slender<br>fingers glided over the keys in a choreographed dance.<br>Their mother sat beside her and joined her, and together,<br>they played a light tune.<br><br>Drawn in by the lovely melody, their grandparents came to<br>listen. The sunlight pouring in from the living room window<br>shone over them like a spotlight on a stage.<br><br><i>My sister and mom are an awful lot alike</i>, the boy<br>thought. Their smiles and voices always cast such a<br>beautiful light on everything around them. In contrast,<br>the boy hated how he felt like a part of a faceless audience,<br>in the darkness made deeper by the light of the stage.<br>He would never be a part of the circle of light—all he could<br>do was watch them from afar.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 10: Bonds Sought (No.10)</p>
<p class="para">The brother and sister wander The Cage and come across a<br>darkness like the ocean's depths. Appearing before them are<br>clusters of lights—giant jellyfish swimming across the sky<br>and smaller bioluminescent larvae floating in their wake.<br><br>The two stand in silence, unable to draw their eyes away<br>from the fantastical sight. The boy thinks back to the time<br>he went to the aquarium when he was very young. Colored<br>lights bathed the jellyfish in the tank, and he remembers<br>what his sister said when she saw them.<br><br>"They're like...gems," her voice scarcely a whisper.<br><br>She sounds the same as she did in his memory. No matter<br>how distant they grow, even if they never speak to each other,<br>they did once spend time together... Perhaps still, they have<br>a sibling's bond.<br><br>They pull out their phones together, turn them in the same<br>direction, and take a picture so that the moment will live<br>on forever.<br><br>When the eclipse cracked and shattered, the sun and<br>the moon brought to life a miracle for these two.<br><br>They do not know why things have come to this.<br>They cannot say who wished for this.<br><br>But for now, all they need is a little more. A little more time<br>to walk side by side as brother and sister, as they once did.</p>
