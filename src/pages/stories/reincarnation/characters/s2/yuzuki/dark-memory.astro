<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">The city is an empty gray expanse.<br>A uniformed group marches through the rubble-strewn<br>streets—a 20-person platoon dispatched by the organization.<br>One boy—quiet by nature—walks behind the rest.<br>His eyes suddenly drop to his feet, and what he sees there steals his words away.<br><br>White powder is strewn over the pavement, blown here and there in the wind.<br>It is salt. But this is no ordinary mineral; this has come from human corpses.<br>White chlorination syndrome.<br>Those afflicted by the disease find their fate in one of two ways.<br>One: Their bodies turn to salt and they die.<br>Two: They lose themselves and become monsters called Legion.<br><br>The quiet boy makes a sound then: a small yip.<br>In an attempt to avoid the blowing salt, he has lost his footing.<br>But he does not hit the ground.<br>A uniformed girl behind him grabs his arm, effortlessly keeping him upright.<br><br>Shocked by her strength, he opens his mouth to thank her.<br>But her mouth widens in a mischievous grin, her crooked teeth on full display.<br>"You tripped on nothing there, man! Goddamn, you really are the Feeble Kid."<br>The boy draws a breath to reply, but finds himself too intimidated to speak.<br><br>"Cut it out," says another girl as she twirls her red hair with a finger. "Us rejects need to get along."<br>The girl with crooked teeth turns her savage gaze towards the redhead.<br>"Who you calling a reject?"<br>"You. Me. All of us. Haven't you noticed? This platoon is made up of underachievers."<br><br>She speaks the truth.<br>The platoon is comprised entirely of rejects.<br>This mission is their last chance to remain with the organization.<br>But the girl with crooked teeth does not accept this.<br>"I bet the people up top are worried about the reject platoon, so they stuck me here as insurance."<br><br>The platoon's mission is to venture into an unexplored area and find a specific individual.<br>Said individual is a researcher.<br>Eyewitnesses claim that though he is afflicted with<br>white chlorination syndrome, he retains his mental faculties.<br>They must find this man. If they do not, the platoon will be out of chances.<br><br>"Hey, c'mon," says a small boy with uneasy eyes. "Stop fighting."<br>This boy knows the girls will argue forever unless he intervenes.<br>His voice is nasally. His eyes twitch. He is the very picture of a coward.<br>The girl bears her crooked teeth at the cowardly boy and hisses, sending him scuttling away.<br><br>The quiet boy gives the rowdy trio a sidelong glance.<br>Sighing, he turns his gaze to the sky and examines the gloomy violet cloud that hangs low over the city.<br><i>It's coming.</i><br>He knows this. He has known it since they first set foot in the city two hours and forty-two minutes ago.<br>Rain is on the way, a torrential downpour with lightning, wind, and fury.<br><br>The quiet boy hoped conditions would improve, but it is not to be.<br>"Guys?" he says.<br>If a storm is incoming, they need to change their route.<br>But no one replies. Instead, they come to a sudden halt and fix their eyes on a spot.<br>Color slowly drains from their faces.<br><br>"Legion," whispers a platoon member.<br>Their voice is despair.<br>A skyscraper stands on the edge of collapse, its metal frame bared to the open air. And behind it, Legion.<br>This is the fate of a person who becomes infected with white chlorination syndrome and loses control.<br><br>Its outer shell is hardened bone—a cross between an insect and a crustacean.<br>And it is easily over 130 feet tall.<br>Fear and bewilderment race through the platoon;<br>they had no warning so massive an enemy might be waiting for them.<br><br>Humans of flesh and blood—and rejects at that—stand no hope against it.<br>It is so unreal, the platoon has trouble accepting it.<br>The Legion slowly turns to look at them.<br>Time is short, now.<br>As a single screaming mass, they turn and run into a nearby ruin of a building.<br><br>Behind them, the monster's howl causes their ears to bleed.<br>The building in which they sought shelter shudders, scarcely holding together.<br>The Legion is attempting to smash the building and everyone inside it.<br>The platoon members shudder in terror, their minds threatening to break at any moment.<br>All except the quiet boy.<br>His breaths alone remain measured. Steady. Calm.<br><br>He stares out the window and thinks.<br>Beyond the shattered glass, small droplets of rain quickly turn into a torrential downpour.<br>Flashes of lightning illuminate gray clouds, followed by thunder nearly as loud as the Legion's howl.<br><br>Suddenly, realization strikes.<br>He knows how they can escape—and more than that,<br>how his platoon of rejects can defeat the Legion outside.<br>"I have an idea," he says.<br>The cold steel in his voice instantly stills the panic rippling through his fellows.<br><br>Prompted by their gazes, he begins to explain.<br>He tells them how they can get out of this despair. About his one-in-a-million bet.<br>The platoon hesitates at first, but they eventually realize it is the only hope they have.<br>At least it's better than waiting for death.<br><br>The quiet boy runs up a set of collapsing stairs to the roof and looks down over the city.<br>Positioning himself somewhere with a clear view of the city below,<br>he begins issuing orders that he hopes will get the Legion's attention.<br><br>First up is the cowardly boy, who bursts from the<br>building and begins to run. He is the swiftest of their group.<br>He is the lure for the Legion. The bait. His fellows make sure the path is open for him.<br>The girl with crooked teeth uses superhuman strength to<br>remove piles of rubble, creating the shortest route to the target location.<br>The rest of the platoon helps as best they can, clearing a path for the boy as he races past.<br><br>The Legion lumbers after him, growing ever closer.<br>But just as it is ready to reach down and rend the cowardly boy in two...<br>"Hey, dummy! Up here!"<br>The redheaded girl's voice echoes around the ruined city.<br>From atop a nearby roof, she fires a bullet that knocks the Legion's hand away.<br><br>Every member of the platoon knows what they must do, and they give their all to the effort.<br>All is going according to plan.<br>Because the quiet boy understands the strengths of his reject platoon.<br>Finally, coward and monster arrive at a suspension bridge on the verge of collapse.<br>A gaping hole yawns beneath it.<br><br>Aging wires extend from worn-out towers,<br>barely holding up the bridge deck as it sways in the storm.<br>The bridge groans as the massive creature steps upon it.<br>A flash of lightning streaks across the sky, covering the empty city in blinding white light.<br>The entire platoon looks up as if in prayer.<br><br>A loud rumble rips apart the sky.<br>Lightning has struck the bridge's supporting tower.<br>Wires twist and snap as the deck begins to give way.<br>The cowardly boy dashes across the undulating surface and leaps to safety.<br>But the Legion is not so coordinated, and it stumbles to the side.<br><br>As it does, the bridge finally gives way, plunging stone and wire and beast down into the abyss.<br>It wails as it falls, giving voice to madness.<br>Though it is unlikely to be dead, the Legion will not be crawling up anytime soon.<br>The platoon rejoices at the quiet boy's brilliance.<br><br>He knew lightning always strikes the highest point.<br>So he had them lead the Legion to the bridge in the hopes a bolt might strike one of the towers.<br>It was not so much a strategy as a last gasp—yet<br>when he proposed the idea, everyone trusted him completely.<br>There are no casualties. The reject platoon lives on.<br>And in that moment, they all begin to praise their newfound savior.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">A platoon of rejects has been given a mission.<br>They are to find a researcher who is afflicted with white chlorination syndrome, yet retains his faculties.<br>On the way, an unexpected enemy appeared: a monster known as Legion.<br>But they worked together to overcome the threat.<br>...Or so they thought.<br><br>"Come in! I repeat, come in. Do you copy? Over!"<br>The quiet boy stands atop a skyscraper. He speaks into his<br>wireless communication device and attempts to issue orders.<br>Yet the only responses he receives are the death throes of his platoonmates.<br>They are the last thing he hears before communications cut off entirely.<br>They avoided one Legion threat, but a total of six were lurking in the area.<br><br>The quiet boy has strategic prowess. His companions have hidden powers.<br>Yet a mere twenty of them cannot hope to take out multiple Legion.<br>They requested backup from the organization, but none is coming.<br>They are cornered now. Trapped. Doomed to annihilation.<br><br>He hears his companions screaming for help before Legion howls drown them out.<br>Unsure what to do, the boy stands frozen.<br>He prays this hell might pass him by.<br><br>A sudden quiet descends like a hammer.<br>The rampaging Legion go silent.<br>Then they whirl about as one and begin marching away.<br>They retreat before cornered prey.<br>The boy does not know what is happening.<br>Regardless, it is a miracle. His prayer has been answered.<br><br>His surviving platoonmates slowly make their way to him.<br>They cradle bloody corpses in their arms: remnants of their fellows.<br>Thirteen corpses lay on the floor of a ruined building—including that of the cowardly boy.<br>He was quick, and agreed to act as bait. But he was not fast<br>enough to escape the other Legion, and when they caught him, they tore him limb from limb.<br><br>"This is all <i>your</i> fault!" cries the girl with crooked teeth as she grabs the quiet boy by the collar.<br>Her bloodied face twists into a scowl of rage.<br>"I knew we never should've followed the Feeble Kid."<br><br>The Feeble Kid.<br>The organization's commanding officers use this insult whenever they want to ridicule the boy.<br>And he can never argue with it.<br>"Enough," says the redheaded girl. "The Legion retreated. We've got a chance."<br>The other girl snarls in response.<br><br>"You know they only retreated because they were responding to something, right?"<br>The girl with crooked teeth's lips tremble in fear.<br>"This means there might be a Red Eye nearby."<br><br><i>Red Eye.</i><br>The nickname for intelligent Legion—those whose eyes glow red.<br>They have the ability to control other, mindless Legion, which makes them infinitely more terrifying.<br>The thought that a Red Eye might be in the area makes the quiet boy drop his gaze.<br><br>When he does, his vision alights on the arm of the girl with crooked teeth.<br>He sees white skin in the tears of her sleeve.<br>White. Like salt.<br>"Your arm..."<br>At his words, she looks down at her arm and gasps.<br><br>Those affected by white chlorination syndrome meet one of two ends:<br>They either turn to salt and die, or become Legion.<br>Her face twists in despair as she realizes the future that awaits her.<br><br>And she is not alone.<br>Of the seven survivors, three are infected.<br>Legion. Red Eye. White chlorination syndrome.<br>The platoon has been plunged into the depths of despair.<br>But there is one hope.<br><br>If they can find the researcher who has white chlorination syndrome and yet retains his intelligence...<br>Then maybe, just <i>maybe</i>, they can be saved.<br>"We keep going," says the quiet boy. "Now let's move."</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">A platoon of twenty has become seven after a battle with the Legion.<br>And three of those are infected with white chlorination syndrome.<br>Those afflicted by the disease find their fate in one of two ways:<br>They either turn to salt and die, or become monsters called Legion.<br>Yet the platoon has not surrendered hope.<br><br>The organization has given them a mission.<br>They are to find a researcher who is afflicted with white<br>chlorination syndrome, yet retains his sense of self.<br>If they can do this, they may learn of a way to best the disease.<br>They believe because they must.<br><br>Twilight. Boots clack over a cold floor. The smell of chemicals moves through the boy's nose.<br>The platoon slowly picks their way through a research facility.<br>The researcher should be here somewhere.<br><br>They were lucky not to encounter more Legion on the way here, or the Red Eye that controls them.<br>But as they venture through the facility, disappointment colors their faces.<br><br>The corridor is quiet as the dead. Clumps of salt lie scattered at their feet.<br>The girl with crooked teeth walks beside the boy.<br>Though her expression remains haughty, her hands, white with disease, quiver slightly.<br>The redheaded girl speaks to her kindly.<br>"It's okay. It's going to be okay. We just have to find the researcher."<br><br>After wandering the halls of the silent facility, they find the researcher's name tag.<br>It rests atop a pile of salt in the shape of a human.<br>The boy turns away from his despairing companions and<br>reaches for a sheaf of research documents next to the pile.<br>He flips through the pages and finds accounts of white chlorination syndrome.<br>There is no going back. No cure. Once a person contracts the disease, there is no way to recover.<br><br>With that, their last thread of hope goes taut and snaps.<br>A researcher who retains his wits despite the disease?<br>It is nonsense. Madness.<br>All the boy can do is chuckle.<br><br>The Legion. White chlorination syndrome.<br>After battling for so long against despair, <i>this</i> is what greets them.<br>He crumples the documents in his fist and begins to roar with laughter.<br>A fist of white.<br><br>There are seven survivors.<br>All of whom are now infected.<br>Their bodies no longer obey. All they can do is huddle together in the darkness.<br>The backup they requested is nowhere to be found.<br>They cannot proceed, and they cannot go back.<br><br>"Hey," says a small voice, breaking the silence.<br>It is the girl with crooked teeth.<br>"Sorry for calling you Feeble Kid."<br>Her apology delivered, she slowly begins to tell about herself.<br>As if she is looking back on her life in the face of oblivion.<br><br>She wanted to do more for the organization.<br>But she didn't get along with the brass, and before she knew it, she was labeled a reject...<br>"Sounds familiar," chuckles the redhead.<br>Nods move around the room; all of them are a slightly different version of the same story.<br><br>At first, they all dreamed of being outstanding members of the organization.<br>But once they were labeled as rejects, loneliness crushed whatever hopes they once had.<br>Yet as they sit in this place and slowly turn to salt, they find themselves filled with a shared happiness.<br>If this is to be their end, at least they are able to share it together.<br><br>"What about you?" asks the girl with crooked teeth. "What did you dream of?"<br>She turns to the quiet boy, who thinks carefully for a moment.<br>Then he answers.<br>"I wanted to be a person worthy of my older sister."<br><br>Beyond the window, the large moon hanging in the night sky casts a faint rainbow across the clouds.<br>The boy's calcified hand catches the light and shimmers like a crystal.<br>Looking over the room, he sees the same pale glow surrounding each of his new friends.<br><i>There are worse ways to go than this</i>, he thinks as he lets his eyes slip closed.<br><br>Morning comes.<br>He wakes to a scream.<br>The girl with crooked teeth is no longer smiling. Instead,<br>she has torn the throat out of one of their companions.<br>Madness has taken her. She will become Legion.<br>The redheaded girl turns her gun on the thing that was once her friend.<br>But she cannot pull the trigger.<br><br>The quiet boy bites his lip and shuts down his own emotions.<br>He snatches the gun away and shoots the maddened girl through the head.<br>Five now remain, including himself.<br>They all thought they would sit in that place and wait for death.<br><br>But as that shot rings out, something happens.<br>The organization's reinforcement helicopter finally arrives, the rumble of its landing shaking the facility.<br>A voice comes from static.<br>"Do we have any survivors here? Please respond."<br>The boy replies in a quiet voice, gazing at the corpses of his comrades as he does.<br><br>Five living. And with nothing to show for it.<br>They are taken into organizational custody, leaving the salt-drenched facility behind.<br>And though they have lost much, despair has been held at bay for the moment.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">They are a small platoon of rejects sent into battle by the organization.<br>Though white chlorination syndrome encroaches on their bodies,<br>they have returned home from a Legion-filled hell.<br>Despite paying a heavy price, they have obtained a key piece of information:<br>The researcher who was said to retain his intelligence while living with the disease does not exist.<br>Once it is contracted, there is no way back.<br><br>In a deep recess of the organization's base, the boy lies on the floor of a cage.<br>His skin is white. Frozen. He can no longer move. The disease has almost reached its end.<br><br><i>How did things end up like this?</i><br>After risking their lives for the mission, all that awaited<br>them were endless tests in a cramped and filthy cage.<br>Dimly, the boy hears a woman scream.<br>He slowly turns his gaze outward.<br>A four-limbed monster thrashes wildly.<br><br><i>She used to be a girl. A girl with red hair.</i><br><i>How did this happen?</i><br>He hears more sounds. A door opening. Boots on cold tile.<br>The boy's commanding officer and subordinates have entered the room.<br>He stares at the monster as it thrashes.<br>"This experiment is a failure," he murmurs. "Kill it."<br><br>There is a gunshot. And another. And another.<br>Each time, the monster's screams shake the darkened room.<br>By the time it falls silent, the boy's vision is bathed in red.<br>Words of animosity choke from his whitened throat.<br>"I hate you..."<br>Their mission had been a lie.<br><br>The researcher had been a lie.<br>The mission's true objective was to send the platoon into<br>unexplored areas to see if they would catch white chlorination syndrome.<br>At which point, the organization could observe its progress.<br><br>The redheaded girl had figured it out some time ago.<br>After being taken off to one room or another, she'd gotten a look at some files.<br>The night she told him, a large moon had hung in the<br>sky—just like the one he'd seen above the research facility.<br>She quietly tapped on the ground as she spoke.<br>"We're experiments. That's it. That's all."<br><br>The boy did not believe her at first.<br>But now he understands.<br>They were just cogs in a great wheel of deception.<br>"I have to thank you," says the commanding officer.<br>He stares down at the boy with cold eyes.<br><br>He goes on to explain that the appearance of the Legion had been a surprise.<br>They thought the platoon would be wiped out, but when the boy saved them,<br>the mission—the experiment—was able to continue.<br>"Sadly," concludes the officer, "we have fewer samples than initially estimated."<br><br>The boy does not know how long he has been here.<br>As his body weakens, his hatred grows.<br>It is an angry emotion. Red.<br><br>"We just wanted...to do our best..."<br>The officer tilts his head at the words.<br>"What are you talking about, Feeble Kid? You <i>did</i> do your best.<br>These experiments will serve our better personnel quite well indeed."<br><br>The smiles of his companions flash through the boy's mind.<br>They all dreamed of helping the organization.<br>But now those dreams have been scattered to the winds.<br>In that moment, something snaps deep inside the boy.<br><br>The light in the room turns red.<br>Sirens begin to wail, signaling a Legion attack.<br>Screams echo throughout the base, followed by the wet sound of rotten fruit thrown against a wall.<br>The commander and his men are baffled—and afraid.<br>Things are moving far too fast for them to control.<br>Suddenly, the door is torn from its hinges.<br><br>White aberrations—Legion—tear chunks from fleeing researchers.<br>Meat slips from bone like a glove leaving a hand.<br>Blood. Slaughter. Death.<br>A feeling settles in the boy's chest as he watches from his cage.<br>It is not fear. Nor is it despair.<br>"Heh... Ha ha ha..."<br>His small, dry laugh slowly grows louder.<br>He guffaws madly as he writhes on the floor,<br>laughing and laughing until he is covered in blood and vomit and bile.<br>The feeling...is delight.<br>These people had ridiculed him and his comrades. Called them rejects.<br>Toyed with their lives. And now the bill has come due.<br><br>At last, the Legion stands before the boy.<br>Its aberrant hands tear open the cage with ease.<br>But he is not afraid. Instead, he closes his eyes and patiently waits.<br>And waits. And <i>waits</i>.<br>But the end does not come.<br>Instead, the Legion kneel before him and bow their heads.<br>Bowing before his bright red eyes.<br><br><i>Kill them. Kill the enemies of our Gods. Kill them all.</i><br>Voiceless thoughts fill his head.<br>When he hears this, he finally understands what he has become.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eInEuuZ.jpeg"><p class="para"><i>Red Eye.</i><br>A being who exists to control the Legion and end humanity.<br>It is his presence that brought the Legion here.<br>The boy—the Red Eye—slowly gets to his feet.<br>The commanding officer huddles in the corner.<br>He slowly strides over to him.<br><br>"Please!" cries the man. "No!"<br>He looks at the boy and the Legion behind him as he begs for his life.<br>The man will do anything to live, including flattering the enemy of all humanity.<br>"I always knew you were special! I knew it!<br>And you could use that power for the organization!<br>You're nothing like those rejects! Nothing!"<br><br>His platoonmates—his friends—were all dead.<br>Yet even now, this man cannot help but trample upon their memories.<br>"This would have never happened if you didn't send us into that godforsaken place."<br>The Legion rips the officer to shreds.<br>The boy grinds chunks of meat beneath his heel as he strides out into the corridor.<br><br>Legion perch atop unidentifiable corpses, bowing to the boy as he passes.<br>He takes them into his procession with a smile.<br>When they find a living member of the organization, he kills them.<br>It is revenge.<br>Revenge for himself and his companions.<br>Revenge for being named rejects. Revenge for being discarded.<br><br>At last, silence descends over the base.<br>There is no one left to slight the boy; this place belongs to the Legion now.<br><br>The boy approaches a bowing Legion and gently runs his hand over its body.<br>His crimson eyes turn to the window.<br>The brilliant moon hangs in the clear night sky.<br>Shining over the bloody fortress as though in celebration.</p>
