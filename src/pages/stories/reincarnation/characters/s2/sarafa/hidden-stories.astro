<p class="title">Chapter 1: A Queen and Warm Sand (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">It is morning, when the briny breeze dancing through the<br>palace from the far-off ocean is yet cold.<br><br>As I rise from my bed and stare absently out the window,<br>an urgent message arrives. My daughter's lady-in-waiting<br>has come to deliver the news personally, and her voice<br>quivers as she speaks. <br><br>"The princess has left for the sea, Your Majesty" <br><br>"Thank you for telling me. I am...relieved." <br><br>I am the ruling queen of this country, and the princess of<br>whom she speaks is my daughter. I had a feeling it would<br>turn out this way; a suspicion she would elope with the<br>sailor boy and abandon her nation and people.<br><br>In truth, I was hoping for it.<br><br>Though I married her to a king of a faraway land, she<br>eventually made her way back. Clearly I have no problem<br>with her leaving; in fact, I am rather satisfied with this<br>outcome. My plan was always to have her stumble upon a<br>faint hope she could leave through a seeming coincidence,<br>then make the decision to do so on her own. And now,<br>that plan has borne the most perfect of fruits. <br><br>I turn back to the lady-in-waiting, watching her quietly<br>shuffle away, before returning my attention to the open<br>window. Beyond, I see the prosperity of a land I cultivated<br>and developed. A powerful land. A gathering place of<br>tenacious soldiers.<br><br>How difficult it has been to protect this country!<br><br>I met him—the man who would one day be my prince consort—<br>when I was the age my daughter is now. This land was<br>particularly impoverished, even among all the little <br>countries that dotted the area. Our military might was<br>non-existent, and we were constantly being invaded by our <br>neighbors. And yet, our people were kind, their hearts<br>open-minded. They valued bonds of friendship and love,<br>and were especially warm to those who had nothing.<br><br>And that man—the poorest son of a poorest people—<br>loved this land with all his heart. <br><br>He showed love to parentless children. Served the elderly<br>who would otherwise be alone. Everyone relied on him—<br>and more importantly, they <i>liked</i> him. <br><br>I was enthralled by him when I visited the city on royal<br>family business. Though we spoke only for a moment,<br>his deep, robust voice remained with me even when I<br>returned to the palace. And when I crawled into bed and<br>closed my eyes, all I could see was his face.<br><br>The long and short of it is this:<br>I fell in love for the very first time.<br><br>Naturally, those around me opposed it; our standings in<br>society were too different for such a union to ever work.<br>So they forbade me from seeing him, even going so far<br>as to lock me away in my room.<br><br>But the more they attempted to cool the fires of my heart,<br>the brighter they burned.<br><br>I escaped my room almost every night for our trysts.<br>I ran barefoot down darkened streets—and if I ever stumbled<br>and skinned a knee, I just leapt up and ran all the faster. <br><br>I wanted our love to bloom no matter the cost, and was<br>rewarded when he felt the same. Each night he embraced me,<br>ignoring the scrapes and bruises and loving me in a way<br>no one else could.<br><br>We were unstoppable. <br><br>Ours was a passionate affair that swept the entire country<br>into its wake. There is no tale to tell, no words to use,<br>that could express the sort of daring tale we created.<br>And after countless, tireless efforts, we were finally<br>bound together as one, my relatives acknowledging<br>us as queen and prince consort.<br><br>Husband and wife. <br><br>I was <i>so</i> happy.<br>We were both fulfilled, and that was enough. <br><br>Or so it should have been.<br><br>I adored him deeply. Powerfully. With all of my life. <br><br>Yet one day, my husband—my beloved husband—changed. <br><br>Eyes which had only been for me strayed.<br><br>Strayed to a new life I created.<br><br>It has been this way since the day I gave birth.<br><br>Since the day my husband met our daughter. <br><br>My daughter took my husband from me.<br><br>She took <i>everything</i>.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: A Queen and Fiery Eyes (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">The princess of this country—my daughter—fled our borders<br>with a strange boy and set sail across the sea.<br><br>I never have to see her face again, which is a relief.<br>As the queen, I am satisfied with this outcome. <br><br>I lean back in my chair, my eyes falling shut as I relax,<br>and think of my husband as I once did.<br><br>When I used to wake in the morning, he would brush my hair<br>from my face and whisper how he found it beautiful. His voice<br>was low and sweet, and I loved it like nothing else.<br><br>He would gaze at me cheerfully, gently, a smile ever<br>on his lips. How I adored the warmth in his eyes!<br><br>My husband hung on every little thing I did.<br>His deep affections were for me and me alone.<br><br>I felt a sense of superiority at this, one that made my<br>heart beat prouder than any trappings of royalty. I felt<br>satisfied in a the way only a wife can feel—satisfied<br>that I had my beloved's affections all to myself.<br><br>And I knew he felt the same.<br><br>From the moment he arrived at court, he proved himself a<br>pure, righteous, and skilled prince consort—one talented<br>enough to still even the most bitterly complaining tongue.<br>No one would ever get between us...or so I thought.<br><br>But then, that life was torn asunder for a reason<br>I did not anticipate:<br><br>I gave birth.<br><br>When our daughter let fly with her first wailings, the people<br>of my country gave us their blessings. She was healthy and<br>strong, and more importantly, the spitting image of her parents.<br>But from that moment, my husband's voice, his gaze—all the<br>things that had once been for me alone—were now things<br>reserved only for his daughter.<br><br>He was utterly captivated by his new child.<br><br>He no longer looked at my hair. My face.<br><br>His affections were withdrawn from me;<br>only our daughter proved worthy of his love.<br><br>No one understood just how empty those days were for me—<br>and the most oblivious to my pain was my husband.<br><br>The man who thought he understood every nook and cranny<br>of my heart.<br><br><i>Perhaps he would grow bored of children if I were to bear<br>another</i>, I thought. But in the end, we never had a chance.<br><br>As our daughter grew into a most bright and cheerful girl,<br>my husband was beset with a terrible illness. His days were<br>spent bedridden, coughing in endless, wracking barks.<br>The pain made his mind hazy, and though he never spoke<br>of it aloud, I knew he was suffering terribly.<br><br>I devoted myself to caring for him, even though it would be<br>a lie to say I did so from a place of complete selflessness.<br>I helped him drink. I cleaned his body, I treated him with<br>more love and care than I did even in our days of yore,<br>and this only made my love for him grow deeper.<br><br>But my husband never opened his heart to me again.<br>Instead, as he lays in bed, he would ask me:<br><br>"What did she learn today?" <br><br>"What did she eat today?" <br><br>"I hope she was happy today." <br><br>Our daughter's day. Her growth. Her health.<br>That was all he cared for.<br><br>Though he occasionally thanked me, I knew full well<br>that his words carried no weight.<br><br>His feelings for our daughter <i>crushed</i> me. And as my love<br>for him grew, my hatred for my daughter deepened. I could<br>feel myself warping, but could not stop it any more than<br>a woman can hold back the tide. <br><br>And then, after a thousand risings and settings of the sun,<br>his illness finally claimed him. My care had been for naught.<br><br>And do you know the last thing he said to me?<br><br>"Take care of our people...and our daughter."<br><br>Not <i>once</i> did he mention me. Not <i>once</i> did he give<br>even the most passing of thoughts to our memories together.<br><br>My faint sliver of hope shattered in that moment, and it<br>formed splinters which pain me to this very day.<br><br>In hindsight, perhaps he knew of his encroaching illness.<br>If so, I can perhaps understand why he poured so much<br>love into our daughter.<br><br>But understanding is not acceptance, and it cannot erase<br>the utter hate I hold for the girl in my heart.<br><br>And yet, I carried on, resolving to protect this land <br>and its people just as my husband asked. <br><br>...Even if it meant using our daughter to do so.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: A Queen and a Cold Smile (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">My beloved husband thought only of this nation and our<br>daughter until his dying breath.<br><br>"Take care of our people...and our daughter."<br>These were his last words to me. His final wish.<br>I took that wish to heart, and vowed to look after this nation<br>my husband loved as its queen. To see it grow strong.<br><br>Governing was never my strong suit, so I took the time<br>to learn all about it from the very beginning. I stimulated the<br>economy, increased the number of soldiers at our command,<br>and enhanced our power as a nation. So great was our<br>progress that we could even hold our own in the face of<br>military interference from other countries.<br><br>For the sake of this nation, I hardened my heart and aimed<br>for the stars. I had no qualms using my own daughter if it<br>meant our nation would be better off for it. I devised your<br>classic political marriage, and sought to marry my daughter<br>off to the king of a nation that boasted tremendous military<br>strength so that we might enjoy cordial diplomatic relations,<br>and luckily, my daughter did not doubt my intentions in the<br>slightest. I, meanwhile, was aware of the possibility that she<br>might anger her new husband and end up dead for it...and<br>I was perfectly fine with that outcome.<br><br>If anything, I hoped that she would go off and die someplace<br>I would not need bear witness to it, for no matter how much<br>I despised my daughter, I could never take her life myself.<br>...How could I? She just looks so much like my dear husband<br>and I. She has his bright eyes and cheerful smile, as well as<br>hair just like mine... Hair my husband would fawn over each<br>and every morning, telling me how beautiful it was.<br><br>The hatred I feel toward my daughter is real. As is the envy,<br>and the disgust. I could dress those feelings up in this fancy<br>word and that, but the truth of the matter would never change.<br>And yet...however difficult this may be to believe, I do also<br>love her. She is a memento of my husband, and her blood<br>is my blood.<br><br>I could never begrudge anyone who says my ways are selfish.<br>These contradictory feelings that dwell in my heart are at odds<br>with one another, yet coexist all the same. That is why I could<br>not bring myself to kill my own daughter. That is why I wished<br>for my daughter to die somewhere far beyond my reach.<br><br>My state of mind is complicated. Bizarre. Grotesque, even.<br>But this was the only way I could think of that would allow me<br>to let that hatred out without completely discarding the love<br>I hold in my heart. This was the solution I came up with so<br>that I could live my life without seeing her smiling face...or<br>her dying one.<br><br>But then she came back. Deciding her married life was<br>without hope and remembering her love for this country—<br>her love for me—she came back and looked upon me<br>as she always does, with that smile and those eyes that<br>look so much like my husband's.<br><br>My daughter has surely never once guessed at the hatred<br>I feel for her. She must have always thought that I held<br>nothing but love for my husband and her alike. She most<br>likely always believed that I possessed the same motherly<br>affection for her that all mothers must feel for their children.<br>She has that kind of purity to her, which I felt again when<br>she looked my way and told me how she had been longing<br>to see me again.<br><br>She depends on me. Clings to me...and I simply couldn't<br>stand it. Perhaps I wouldn't have suffered so if my hatred<br>for her were the only problem... It's that smile. It's so<br>adorable in the same way my husband's was that I can't<br>help but understand why it is she was able to steal my<br>husband's love away from me.<br><br>Will this smile hound me for all my mortal days?<br>Is this some punishment the gods have set aside for<br>me? One that I must endure no matter how I might try<br>to focus on making our nation as great as it can be?<br><br>What a cruel joke. If only I could do something to rid her<br>of that smile—something to kill that resemblance to my<br>husband for good—maybe my days would be easier.<br><br>And so I tell her that no matter how much she may have<br>longed to see me, I had not even the slightest hint of a<br>desire to see her in return.<br><br>Her expression grows cold—hopefully forever.<br>Here's hoping I never have to see that smile ever again...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: A Queen and Freezing Sand (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Many suns and moons have come and gone since the day<br>my daughter returned from the place I had married her off to<br>for political gain.<br><br>Since hurting her with my words that day, not once has a smile<br>crossed her face—just as I had hoped. With her face now a<br>permanent frown, I no longer perceive in her a resemblance to<br>my husband, and that has done my heart a world of good.<br><br>However, simply knowing that she lives here in the same<br>palace—that she still draws breath—causes my pain to return<br>all the stronger, and it does not amuse me that is she is now<br>known the nation over as a princess who does not smile.<br><br>And so I set my next plan into motion. If I am to free the palace<br>from my daughter's presence, someone must take her away...<br>Which is why I sent missives far and wide, promising that<br>whoever makes my daughter smile can have her as their bride.<br><br>Our nation has become a splendid one, and a blood relation<br>to its royalty is essentially a guarantee that one will be, for all<br>intents and purposes, set for life. Hoping to secure an easy<br>future for themselves, men from the world over make the<br>journey to stand before my daughter.<br><br>I don't care who it is. And if they're someone who can make<br>my daughter smile, I doubt she'd have any complaints either.<br>If there happens to be someone among them who is of a<br>royal upbringing, well, that would be of some benefit to the<br>nation as well, which would be a plus. What's more, the<br>influx of people coming to see my daughter will surely<br>stimulate our local economy.<br><br>...However, my daughter would smile for no one.<br>It would seem her despair is profound indeed.<br><br>It is not just her smile that left my daughter. Joy, anger,<br>sadness... Every human emotion disappeared alongside it.<br>As I sit behind my daughter and gaze upon the worthless<br>louts that have come to woo her, I begin to feel my own<br>emotions fluctuate. Is this plan of mine doomed to fail?<br><br>As my mood begins to grow dark, I see in my daughter's<br>eyes a glimpse of her former self, though just for a moment.<br><br>It happens as she listens to a story a man—well, a boy,<br>really—tells her. He claims to be a sailor, and my daughter<br>is clearly taken with the tales he spins.<br><br>Her heart is thawing. Perhaps it went unnoticed by the masses.<br>I am unsure if my daughter even realizes it herself, but I know<br>those eyes all too well. They are just like my husband's.<br>Those are the eyes that lovingly gazed upon me.<br>The eyes he only ever had for me.<br><br>Some time passes, and I receive word from my daughter's<br>lady-in-waiting that my she has eloped and taken to the sea.<br>I did the same thing once, having absconded from my room<br>after having my heart stolen by a poor commoner.<br><br>If my daughter had wanted to marry the boy I surely would<br>not have refused, but if she would rather sever our ties by<br>eloping instead, that is fine by me. Thinking about how I've<br>finally been freed from her blasted smile, I laugh to myself<br>as I sit in one of the palace's inner chambers.<br><br>There is no one here to curse me. Now I can simply live as<br>I please. Thinking back on all the hardships I've experienced,<br>I look out over my nation from a nearby window.<br><br>What I see before me is a city that has grown massive<br>beyond comprehension. It burns with the passion of youth.<br>Merchants rip off the commonfolk with their heads held high.<br>Members of the military spend their days thinking up plans<br>to pillage other nations. There is no refuge for the weak here—<br>it is a nation made great by concept of the survival of the fittest.<br>It is a strong country. A country of plenty.<br><br>Never again will I see my husband again, nor will I ever see<br>our daughter who looks so much like him. What's more,<br>it seems like I will never again see even the slightest trace<br>of the nation he loved so dear.<br><br>This country has become an ideal nation. The kind of place<br>other nations aspire to. I did my duty well. And yet...<br><br>The things that I loved? The things that my husband loved?<br>They're gone. They're all gone. Search as you may, you will<br>never find them, for they no longer exist on this earth.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: Today's Fortune (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">Carrier: How dare they look down on people like this!<br>How dare they toy with people's hearts!<br>This is ■■■■■■■■!<br><br>Carrier proclaims in a loud voice.<br><br>This statement troubles Dark Mama.<br><br>Mama: Well gosh, even if that's true,<br>I feel like you're in no position to talk.<br><br>Carrier: And what is that supposed to mean?<br>What's wrong with calling out the ■■■■ for what it is?<br>I will admit those fortunetelling powers seemed to be<br>the genuine article, but using them to do evil is beyond<br>outrageous! Then again, I suppose those who choose<br>to believe are in the wrong too, hmm?<br>There will always be fools who cling to their fortunes,<br>so perhaps a bunch of shady fortune tellers comes<br>with the territory!<br><br>Carrier goes on. Dark Mama is astonished. <br><br>Mama: He and I might not get along so well...<br><br>Babe: His horoscope for today was pretty crummy.<br><br>Mama: I quite enjoy fortunes myself, but perhaps<br>he's taking it all a little too seriously?</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: Maid's Diary: Fateful Job (No.06)</p>
<p class="para">XX/XX<br>Sunny <br><br>The queen summoned me today. She says it's now my job<br>to serve the princess because we're both the same age.<br>It's such an honor!<br><br>The princess has super fluffy hair and big, round eyes.<br>She's very pretty. <br><br>The princess was hidden behind the queen, but she said,<br>"Let's read a book together." So I read her a book. <br>She swayed happily as I did so. It was very cute.<br><br>Thinking about being here every day to help her feels<br>like a dream. My heart leaps in my chest.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 7: Maid's Diary: Fateful Decision (No.07)</p>
<p class="para">XX/XX<br>Cloudy<br><br>The princess has snuck out of the palace yet again.<br>I cannot help but worry, as the outside world is so<br>terribly dangerous. Recently, no matter how much<br>I advise caution the princess refuses to listen,<br>and instead simply dismisses me with a sly smile.<br><br>While it pained my heart to do so, I felt it necessary<br>to inform the queen of her behavior. However, the queen<br>told me to simply leave her be. Not only does the princess<br>have no father, it seems like her mother the queen has<br>no particular interest in providing her with the attention<br>she requires either.<br><br>Alas! How tragic it all is for our poor, precious princess.<br>I must protect her. I am the only one who can.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 8: Maid's Diary: Fateful Parting (No.08)</p>
<p class="para">XX/XX<br>Rain<br><br>The princess was suddenly married off to a king of a faraway<br>land. Forward of me though it was, I pleaded with the queen<br>to remain in the princess's service, but she disapproved. <br><br>But why? I have been the closest to the princess thus far<br>and have cared for her like no other.<br><br>Today, the queen ordered me to clean up the princess's room.<br>Indeed, she may come home one day. It must be spotless for<br>her return.<br><br>Her bed looks so inviting. I don't suppose she would mind<br>if I lay on it just a little, would she?</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 9: Maid's Diary: Fateful Reunion (No.09)</p>
<p class="para">XX/XX<br>Sunny<br><br>What a development! The other day, the princess returned from<br>the country she was sent to so that she might marry its king!<br>She seems a woman changed, however, for she simply does<br>not smile like she used to. So grave is her condition that the<br>queen has issued a proclamation stating that any who can<br>make her smile shall have her hand in marriage.<br><br>It pains me to think that I might be separated from the princess<br>yet again. I think our unsmiling princess is wonderful in her own<br>way—she carries herself with such dignity now—but I would<br>also love to see that innocent smile return to her face.<br><br>...If it did, however, that would mean she'd have to leave again.<br>If the princess were to smile again despite the appearance of<br>a partner who made her do so, would the talk of her being<br>married off go away? In that case, maybe I...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 10: Maid's Diary: Fateful Wish (No.10)</p>
<p class="para">The princess asked that I switch places with her.<br>She says she intends to test the feelings the boy claims<br>to have for her. Ah, but if only there was a world where her<br>wishes were the sort that I could refuse. The boy, fool that<br>he is, left the palace thinking I was the princess.<br>There is no need for me to interfere. The princess will<br>surely come to her senses of her own accord.<br><br>...Or so I thought, but then the princess took to the sea with<br>the boy on a small boat, and I was unable to stop her.<br>The princess had a look of both joy and despair to her<br>person, and I was left unable to do anything at all.<br><br>That is not my princess. My sweet princess, the princess<br>I cherish and adore, is... Yes, that's right... That's her smile.<br>It is the smile I see in the mirror before me. That's her.<br>That's the delightful princess I know and love.</p>
