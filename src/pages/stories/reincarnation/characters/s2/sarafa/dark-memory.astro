<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A small country lies nestled between dry sand and fertile sea, its capital an<br>assortment of haphazardly placed spires and domed rooves.<br>"Before it sits a vast desert, one that claims the lives of any who might<br>threaten the city."<br>"Behind it lies a vast ocean, one where ships laden with precious cargo from<br>across the world come and go."<br>Within the capital, there is a palace. Within the palace, there is a corridor.<br>And dashing through the corridor, there is a single girl.<br>Though she runs with wild abandon, none dare scold her.<br>For she is the country's princess.<br>"Mother!" she cries as she bursts into a room. "You called for me!?"<br>The room boasts high ceilings and cool breezes reminiscent of the finest desert resort.<br>Finely-crafted furniture fills every corner.<br>The person the girl calls "mother" lays claim to this place, as well as the rest of the country.<br>She is queen of this land; all of its prosperity flows to her.<br>"I did call you," the queen begins. "For today, I would speak with you of marriage."<br>She hands the princess a scroll.<br>Written at its top is the name of a country the princess does not recognize.<br>As well as a terrifying phrase: <i>marriage of state</i>.<br>As royalty, the princess lacks the right to choose her husband.<br>And though she knew this moment was coming, she cannot hide her concern.<br>"Worry not," says the queen as she senses her daughter's unease.<br>"I have selected a most excellent partner."<br>Memories from her life come rushing back to the princess.<br>She recalls conversations with her beloved mother, as well as her secret life as a<br>fortune teller—a thing of which only her lady-in-waiting is aware.<br>It had all taken place here, in this land betwixt sand and sea.<br>As tears well in the girl's eyes, the queen pulls her into an embrace.<br>"All mothers, no matter their station, pray for their daughter's happiness."<br>The tears are loosed now, flowing down her face and onto the uncaring marble below.<br>But the girl knows her mother has her best interests at heart. And in that moment, it is enough.<br>A lengthy procession snakes through silvery, moonlit sands.<br>The princess's procession.<br>She sits inside her litter, surrounded before and behind by a wealth of<br>effusive gifts personally selected by her mother the queen.<br>Bored, she gazes out through a mesh-covered window at the brilliant night sky.<br>She is heading for a land rich in ore and precious metals.<br>Her mother has long desired such things, and hopes that marrying her daughter to the<br>country's ruling family will allow her to secure them under advantageous conditions.<br>But first, the princess must earn the king's<br>fancy and prove to his ministers that she is an asset of value.<br>It will be difficult, time-consuming work. But the girl is confident.<br>For she is particularly adept at reading the hearts of others and manipulating them to her liking.<br>She has spent many a long night wandering the city in the guise of a fortune teller,<br>and such pursuits for people's true essences should prove useful here.<br>Nerve. Curiosity. Ambition.<br>These things and more well within her as she sits inside her litter and watches the breaking dawn.<br>Finally, the procession reaches its destination.<br>The princess is hurried off to an astonishingly vast room so she might prepare for her wedding.<br>She is dressed in a spotless white dress stitched with brilliant gold thread that catches the light.<br>The army of maids who surround her swoon and sigh at the sight.<br>But what captures the princess's heart is not the<br>gorgeous dress, but the shape of the city against the horizon.<br>For the buildings outside her window shine even more brilliantly than her dress.<br>Unlike her gritty, sand-covered home, this city is a land enveloped in white, dreamlike beauty.<br>Suddenly, the door swings wide, causing the maids to immediately bow their heads.<br>"Ah, my new wife. At last we meet."<br>The princess looks up to see a handsome, bearded man in the prime of his life.<br>He is the king—the ruler of this land, and the man who would be her husband.<br>Taking her hand, the king leads her to a courtyard facing the palace.<br>Waiting there is a large portable shrine, as well as a sea of citizens.<br>"Welcome to our nation," says the king as the people burst into a raucous cheer.<br>Dancing petals fill her vision. Music swirls around her.<br>In every corner of the courtyard, people are drinking and dancing with wanton abandon.<br>"Hail the new queen!"<br>"Long life to our new queen!"<br>"Pray look this way, Queen!"<br>Princess and king sit in the portable shrine as it<br>begins slowly making its way down the crowded city streets.<br>Today the girl begins a new life in this dazzling land.<br>A place where everyone receives her with warmth and grace.<br>Any doubts she harbored about earning the love of the king and his people quickly fall away.<br>She will give her life to this land—for her mother's sake as well as her own.<br>She will live with the handsome king beside her and do all she can to see her new people happy.<br>With a small nod, she makes peace with her decision.<br>"Attention, everyone!" cries the king suddenly. "It is time for today's entertainment!"<br>The mood of the people immediately turns from excitement to frenzy.<br>With one hand still gently grasping the princess's own,<br>the king receives an axe from one of his retainers.<br>The polished blade reflects the sunlight. The worn handle is blackened with dirt.<br>"What are you going to do?" asks the bemused princess.<br>"It is time you learned how we enjoy ourselves in this land," he responds.<br>Together, they step down from the shrine and into the sea of people.<br>He swings the axe. Once. Twice. Again.<br>With each swing, a citizen's head soars away into the air, followed by a brilliant fountain of blood.<br>The princess hears no screams. No panic. All is naught but blood and fevered cheers.<br>The brilliant, unspoiled plaza is soon dyed the deepest crimson.<br>The princess's beautiful white dress is bright vermilion.<br>She screams, then, a sound lost amidst the revelry.<br>"Onward, my queen!" cries the king as he leads her<br>through the crowd swinging his gore-soaked axe.<br>Whether she follows him by choice or force is a question she cannot answer.<br>Her every movement is greeted with a shower of blood,<br>one more step along the path of a wedding most bloody.<br>She suddenly feels her carefully crafted plans wither and die inside her.<br>Those she had manipulated in her life were normal people. Easy people.<br>The type who might come to a fortune teller for advice.<br>But the handsome king she is to marry is something altogether different.<br>He is a man cruel beyond all measure. A man whose senses have abandoned him.<br>And as the people of this mad king eagerly die<br>before him with grins plastered across their faces...<br>The princess can only look on in horror.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">A small kingdom lies nestled between sand and sea.<br>The princess of this kingdom was sent to a faraway land and<br>married off so her beloved mother might find greater prosperity.<br>But to her horror, her new husband is a bloodthirsty, mad king who<br>slaughtered his own people for entertainment at their wedding.<br>Days after the bloody ceremony, the woman stares out the window with haunted eyes.<br>The king has given her a vast room with a stunning view.<br>Its massive windows look out over the plaza where the wedding took place.<br>There, people chat idly, lazing about beneath the gentle rays of the sun.<br>The king bathed the floors and walls of the plaza with blood on that day of the frenzied feast.<br>But now, all has been returned to normal, the red walls and floors painted white once more.<br>She recalls what a retainer said to her about the paint:<br>"Aye, my new queen. It's made from ash, as well as shells harvested from the nearby waters."<br>She looks out across the country again. The high castle walls, the floors,<br>and the houses are all covered in that same spotless white.<br>She understands now why that is.<br>For her new husband—the land's king—engages in his bloody hobby on an almost daily basis.<br>She tears her gaze away from the plaza, ready to enjoy a quiet moment to herself.<br>But her reverie is interrupted by the pealing of a bell.<br>It rings once. Twice. A third time.<br>This bell sits at the highest point of the city and can be heard for miles.<br>Its ringing is how the king summons her.<br>She quickly readies herself and makes her way to his side.<br>She finds him in a circular arena at the center of the palace—a<br>place where fighting tournaments are held.<br>"I've been waiting for you, my beautiful new queen!" he says as he scoops her<br>into an embrace and deposits her in the empty seat beside him.<br>She has been summoned here so she might watch the upcoming battle.<br>Two stout and scarred men stand in the arena.<br>The king takes great joy in such events; he makes them pummel each<br>other until one lies dead, then strikes down the winner with his own hand.<br>But the woman cannot revel in such an abattoir, and so looks away.<br>Her eyes alight on a spire that stands outside the palace. Blood clings to its sides like thick honey.<br>The day prior, the king had amused himself by gathering<br>people at the spire while he skewered criminals atop it.<br>Even the worst slavers and criminals would find such acts unthinkable in the princess's homeland.<br>But here, they are commonplace. Games, even.<br><i>He is mad</i> she thinks.<i> He is </i>utterly<i> mad.</i><br><i>How did he possibly trick my mother into accepting this marriage?</i><br>Without warning, the king gently squeezes the princess's hand,<br>leaning his handsome face close to her own.<br>"I hope you are enjoying the game," he whispers into her ear.<br>Such "games" are naught but means to toy with the lives of others.<br>Whenever he indulges himself in one, he calls her to his side.<br>He drags her from one bloodbath to the next, just as he did at the wedding.<br>And as she gazes at the mighty walls that protect this gorgeous land, a thought occurs to her:<br><i>This country is beautiful.</i><br><i>Yet it is nothing but a trap to lure in prey—an inescapable prison.</i><br>As the sun sets and shadows stretch across the city, the princess is<br>finally freed from her husband's latest amusement.<br>She is beginning to feel herself growing numb to the daily parade of tragedies<br>that unfold before her. It is a realization that <i>terrifies</i> her.<br>Only here, in her own room, can she manage to find a sense of calm.<br>A full moon hangs in the sky.<br>She steps onto the balcony, gazes up at the sky, and thinks of her home. Of her mother.<br>As this country's new queen, she has been treated most excellently.<br>But her days are also filled with loneliness—and pain.<br>Every one of the attendants who accompanied her on her journey<br>has been slaughtered. She is utterly alone.<br>But she will carry on. It is her duty to her country. To her mother.<br>As that thought crosses her mind, she finds herself briefly refreshed.<br>She whirls on one heel and makes to return to the room.<br>But before she can move, she notices a faint mark on the wall.<br>It would be invisible if not for the light of the full moon.<br>She follows in the direction it points and finds herself facing one of her bedposts.<br>She reaches behind the post until she feels something solid.<br>A diary.<br>Sitting on the edge of her bed, she begins to read.<br>The author is one of the previous women sent here to marry the king.<br>It includes observations regarding the nation, plus<br>small grievances about her life and the king's routine.<br>The woman had noticed how people called her the "new queen."<br>But that raised the question: Where did the previous queen—or <i>queens</i>—go?<br>As she reads, she finds her answer.<br>And when she does, her mouth cracks opens in a silent scream.<br>The writing is hurried. Sloppy.<br><i>While he shows his wives deep affection, he always grows tired<br>of them within five full moons past the wedding.</i><br><i>After that, he disposes of them and begins looking for a new wife.</i><br><i>So many queens have died by his hand.</i><br>There is more to the diary, but she is too scared to turn the page.<br>Her mind whirls. She tries to think, but cannot.<br><i>How many full moons has it been?</i><br>The bell tolls suddenly.<br>Once. Twice. A pause...and then a third time.<br>The king is calling for her.<br>But this time, the princess is frozen in place.<br>She imagines the misfortune that awaits her and feels her heart clench.<br>Every day is a game for her new king. And soon, it will be her turn to play.<br>Oddly, the next thing she thinks of is her mother's kind face.<br>"All mothers, no matter their station, pray for their daughter's happiness."<br>Her mother had said that, turning the words into a kind of tiny prayer.<br>A prayer that she might be happy in her new life,<br>even if it was a marriage not of her own choosing.<br>She does not wish to break her kind mother's heart by dying in a foreign land.<br>For she knows her death would bring her great sadness.<br><i>I must return home alive. I must see my mother again.</i>.<br>And so she quietly makes up her mind to escape her new country—and to escape her king.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">In a faraway country, a mad king toys with people's lives.<br>One night, the woman who was now his wife found a diary in her room.<br>The author was a queen who came here long before her—a queen that had since vanished.<br>Written on the inside was a terrifying truth: Many queens had met their end by the king's own hand.<br>This is why the woman knows she will soon fall victim to her husband's madness.<br>"The way you wield your sword is simply beautiful, my darling! You enchant me!"<br>With a smile, she grasps the king's hand.<br>Clutching it as she showers in the blood of her subjects.<br>Her words prompt the king to adjust his grip as he mows through another group of people.<br>She found a truth in the old diary:<br>After five full moons spent with his new queen, the king will grow weary and dispose of her.<br>She knows her life is in his hands.<br>So she puts on her best act in the faint hope he might not tire of her.<br>The king's game comes to a close. All goes quiet for another night.<br>The princess steps from her bed and slips silently into the city.<br>She walks in shadow, her eyes peering out from the dark.<br>The walls are too high. The guards too numerous.<br>Though this country is at peace, security is abnormally tight.<br>All so her husband might create a stalwart cage from which none might escape.<br>The woman acts amiably during her daylight hours so she might delay her impending demise.<br>But she is also buying time. Time to prepare. Time to ready herself.<br>Time to escape.<br>The king's guards are ever watchful. During meals. During sleep. Even at the privy.<br>If she is to outfox so cautious and clever a man, she needs more time.<br>She looks up at the moon, calculating how many days remain to her.<br>All the while searching for a way home.<br>Her only clues are those left in the diary.<br>But time passes without mercy, and the people no longer refer to her as the "new" queen.<br>Finally, one night, she sees the moon hanging round and low in the sky.<br>It is the fifth time she has seen such a sight.<br>She has assembled everything she needs to escape.<br>A sack stuffed with rations. A skin of water. A tightly wound rope.<br>She slings her things over her shoulder and steps onto the windowsill.<br>Moving on nimble feet, she lands in the palace garden.<br>Suddenly, a voice rings out.<br>"Taking in the night air, my queen?"<br>She whirls around, her heart in her throat.<br>The king stands before her clutching an axe.<br>The bell tolls.<br>It rings once. Twice. A pause...and then a third time.<br>Her final summons.<br>Before she can move, the king's hand lashes out and secures her arm in an iron grip.<br>Ignoring her screams, he begins pulling her toward their private bath.<br>The shrewd king has seen through the woman's actions.<br>Many queens before her have attempted escape. All have failed. All have died.<br>The king boasts proudly of his feats as he steps into the bath.<br>He begins to fiddle with a hidden mechanism somewhere in the center.<br>"And now, my dear wife, we begin our final game."<br>As he speaks, a small hole opens in the bath.<br>Water floods through the hole, draining the bath and revealing a small staircase.<br>It is the entrance to a hidden room known only to the king.<br>The pair makes their way down the stairs in silence.<br>At the bottom is a stone room illuminated by faint torchlight.<br>When the princess enters it, despair falls over her features.<br>But the king only smiles wider, his face made all the more handsome for it.<br>The secret room has but one purpose: killing his queen.<br>The king speaks then, praising the woman for amusing him for five full moons.<br>As he does so, a stone falls over the stairway, cutting off all hope of escape.<br>The room is filled with tools the woman has never before seen.<br>But she needs no explanation as to their purpose: They exist to break people.<br>The king lays his hand on one such tool and gives her a crooked, twisted smile.<br>"This is your final job, my queen."<br>It is a scene the king has played out time and again.<br>But this time, something different happens.<br>The woman does not cry. She does not beg. Instead, she looks him right in the eye and begins to giggle.<br>"Does this amuse you?" he growls.<br>It is the first time she has ever seen him angry—likely<br>because she has never shown him anything but outright deference.<br>As she continues to giggle, a range of emotions wash over the king's face.<br>Anger turns to rage, before slowly giving way to a hint of doubt.<br>And then, for the briefest of moments, fear.<br>The woman does not let the chance escape.<br>She leaps into the corner of the room and picks up a hidden spear.<br>Before the king can even draw breath, she plunges it into his chest.<br>Her attack is nowhere near powerful enough to fell so large and strong a man as her new husband.<br>Yet he begins to foam at the mouth before dropping to one knee.<br>For you see, a powerful poison has been lathered on the spear head.<br>"You thought this room yours alone," whispers the woman in his ear. "But it is not."<br>As the king writhes and thrashes on the ground, the princess tosses the diary in front of him.<br>It is the work not of one queen, but <i>all</i> of them.<br>Each poor soul who married the king wrote down what she knew before dying—and the<br>previous queen was the one who finally figured out the location of the secret room beneath the bath.<br><i>I don't know if I'll be able to escape. But whoever is reading this,<br>you can be the one to end this. You must.</i><br>That was the final entry in the diary.<br>And so, the woman snuck into the hidden room ahead of time,<br>ensuring the sacrifices of the previous queens would not be in vain.<br>The king relished in tormenting the weak, and his wives were no exception.<br>But he took too much joy in such proceedings, and so made himself vulnerable.<br>Which is how his latest wife has now come to stand over his pathetic, quivering form.<br>"My poor king," she says in a mocking, melodic voice.<br>"Does that hurt? Would you like me to hold your hand?"<br>But she receives no response. At long last, the mad king is dead.<br>She pulls a string in the corner of the room, causing the floor to slide open, revealing a deep pit.<br>Unfathomable amounts of blood have dried and<br>stuck to the walls like the massive artery of a long-dead giant.<br>It is where the king threw the bodies of his wives when he was done with them.<br>The princess gazes into the deep, dark hole.<br>Beyond lies a future not written in the diary.<br>But she produces her rope and carefully vanishes into the pit all the same.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">On the night of the fifth full moon, the woman kills her husband and slips free of her palace prison.<br>All so she might return to the mother who loves and worries for her deeply.<br>Before she left, she found the sight of her home to be tired and uninteresting.<br>But now the haphazard spires and clustered domes strike her as beauty personified.<br>She is back in the land wreathed by sea and sand. Her birthplace. Her home.<br>Once she escaped the mad king's grasp, she used what<br>little treasure and rations she had to barter passage through the desert.<br>Now having returned, she sets her sights on the royal<br>palace and limps her way through bustling city streets.<br>She is surrounded by market stalls selling rare spices and<br>exotic fabrics her mother has obtained through trade.<br>None of the lands she passed through on her journey home were so lively—or so bountiful.<br><i>Mother truly is amazing</i>, she thinks.<br>When her mother was born, this nation was a poor and barren wasteland.<br>But her mother cultivated it, negotiated with distant countries, and brought great wealth to their shores.<br>The palace is close now. So close.<br>Though she passes many citizens on the street, none realize she is the princess.<br>The scent of blood and decay hangs all around her. Her body is coated in dust.<br>All who see her turn away in disgust.<br>She is nothing to them. Some filthy beggar. Some wretch.<br>But she cares not, because she is <i>alive</i>.<br>That truth is all that matters now.<br>As she walks the palace's unending corridors, retainers<br>and maids look at her with varying expressions.<br>Some regard her with curiosity. Some show relief.<br>But mostly, what she sees is shock.<br>"Mother!"<br>Her hoarse voice sounds for the first time in ages as she<br>bursts into her mother's room and collapses on the floor.<br>Just as when they first spoke of marriage, her mother sits at the far end of a long table.<br>She is queen. The room belongs to her, as does the country.<br>When the princess sees her mother's face, relief floods her heart.<br>Ignoring the pain of her parched throat, she begins a<br>rapid-fire retelling of how she escaped the mad king.<br>Once she finishes her breathless tale, she gives her mother a smile and waits for her own in return.<br>But it does not come.<br>Instead, there is only disappointment.<br>It is a wholly unexpected reaction—one which causes the princess to reel.<br>"Why did you come back?" asks her mother softly.<br>The princess blinks, befuddled.<br>She thought her mother would be delighted to see her.<br>She thought she would sweep her up in her arms and<br>offer words of gratitude for the daughter who risked all to make her happy.<br>"I cannot be happy if you are not happy," says the queen coolly.<br>"So I needed you to be happy in your new home. No matter what."<br>As the princess tries desperately to still her reeling<br>mind, she stops and takes in her surroundings.<br>Uncountable maids and servants flit to and fro through the palace corridors.<br>They carry precious timber. Rare spices. Great bolts of silk.<br>Materials used for funerals.<br>Her mother sinks low in her chair and gazes into space for a moment before continuing.<br>"Of course the mad king tried to kill you. He kills all his wives.<br>But since you've come back, I suppose there's little use for..."<br>She trails off and waves a hand in the air. "All of <i>this</i>."<br>She claps at a nearby retainer, who bows and awaits instruction.<br>"Cancel my daughter's funeral, and do it now! Do you have <i>any</i> <br>idea how much this is costing me?"<br>The maids and servants immediately stop setting up the<br>funeral trappings and begin tearing them down instead.<br><i>But why?</i><br>Before the princess can ask the question in her mind, the queen tells her everything.<br>The mad king's country, while mostly insignificant, holds great quantities of ore and precious metals.<br>In exchange for a share of those resources, royal families<br>the world over send their daughters there to be sacrifices.<br>Her mother has known this since the day the princess was born.<br>She waited years for her daughter to come of age so she could send her off to be slaughtered.<br>All this was done so the country she built with her own own hands might become even more powerful.<br>So she might obtain the future she envisioned for herself.<br>But the princess is both clever and pragmatic, and she accepts this new reality far faster than most.<br>Her mother has not betrayed her. Oh no.<br>For one cannot betray a thing they were never loyal to in the first place.<br>The princess slowly closes her eyes. She wavers in place,<br>noting dimly how her body hurts in ways she never imagined it could.<br>"Yes, well, it seems I'll have to increase security so you don't escape next time," says her mother.<br>Having thus cleansed her daughter's wound with salt, the queen and her attendants scuttle away.<br>She does not even take the time to spare a final glance for her daughter.<br>Time passes. A minute. Hours.<br>The princess walks alone down an endless stone corridor.<br>No smile graces her face now.<br>The mad king had constructed a prison.<br>Yet when she finally escaped, she found herself trapped in another.<br>It is a cage she will never be able to flee.<br>All because she was born a princess. All because she is her mother's daughter.<br>And having realized this truth, her once-brilliant smile is lost forever to the cruel reality of despair.</p>
