<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">She was brought here as a child so long ago. Days. Months. Years. Who can even say anymore? <br>The reliefs carved on the outer walls seem to deny all who would dare seek entry to this place. <br>The wooden door creaks ominously whenever it opens. <br>Each time, she sees a corridor shimmering with sunlit beauty as <br>all the colors of the rainbow filter in through stained glass.<br><br>This is the school of magick. It has always been thus, and thus will it always be. <br>With everyone at rest this holiday morning, the school lies quiet as a grave. <br>But one student is up and about. It is the wavy-haired girl, <br>who has abandoned the possibility of sleep in order to sneak into the school kitchens. <br>Once there, she sets her bag on a table and reaches up for a nearby shelf.<br><br>One by one, she begins pulling down utensils. She takes each item and carefully sets <br>it next to a pile of ingredients and a recipe book. When this task is complete, <br>she wipes a bit of sweat from her eyes and dons an apron. By their own kind of magick, <br>the girl's assembled ingredients eventually become a thin, flat disc of dough. <br>She takes a heart-shaped cutter and begins to stamp out smaller pieces from it. <br>Once ready, her cookies slide into a warm oven.<br><br>After a minute of waiting, a sweet, gentle scent drifts across the empty kitchen. <br>The girl kneels down and peers through the glass oven door, <br>watching as her treats slowly turn a golden brown. "I hope you taste good," she whispers.<br><br>The children at the school of magick all live together. With a sizeable roster of students, <br>there are always a couple dozen sharing birth months in any given term. <br>Next month is the wavy-haired girl's turn, along with one of her friends from class. <br>The wavy-haired girl is practicing making the gift she intends to give her, <br>because she wants it to be perfect. She pulls a cookie from the oven and bites into an edge. <br>Flavors dance on her tongue, as well as an almost indescribably subtle sweetness.<br><br>Her mouth bends into a smile. <i>These will work</i>, she thinks. <i>These are good.</i> <br>Now she just needs to practice her wrapping skills. Still smiling, she tidies up the kitchen, <br>picks up her cookies, and returns to the dorm. She places her bag on her desk and waits for <br>the special gift-wrapping fabric she had ordered to arrive. She would use some of <br>it to wrap her practice batch of cookies and give the entire thing to her best friend, <br>the bespectacled girl who lives next door. <br>Suddenly, the soft sound of a bell echoes through the room.<br><br><i>My fabric!</i> Delighted, she flings the door wide...only to find her teacher standing there. <br>She looks her teacher in the eye and smiles calmly, hoping her expression does not betray <br>the butterflies that suddenly race inside her stomach. "Yes?" she asks. "What is it?"<br><br>Excuses for her recent kitchen excursion race through her mind. With an indecipherable look, <br>the teacher slowly reaches out and hands her an envelope. <br>She pauses, unable to process what is happening. Finally, she manages to speak. <br>"Is that...a letter?" There is a slight tinge in her voice. Relief, perhaps?<br><br>Regardless, her teacher does not notice. "Yes. A letter. Come find me once you've read it." <br>As she takes it with a puzzled look, her teacher turns around and departs. <br>She closes the door and stares at her new prize. The crisp white envelope has been closed with <br>a wax seal. <i>It's so formal</i>, she wonders. <i>What could it be?</i><br><br>She withdraws an opener from a drawer and slips it under the wax seal. <br>When she pulls the letter free, she sees that it is from the hospital in her hometown. <br><i>...The hospital? But why?</i> She begins to read the words on the page, <br>her eyes darting back and forth like moths before a flame. The writing is clinical. The message brief.<br><br>Her mother has been admitted. As she ruminates over this new information, she feels the tips of <br>her fingers grow cold. What should her response be? <br>What would it be if she came from a normal family? The moment the thought enters her mind, <br>she knows her reaction is wrong. Her mother is ill. Perhaps dying. Yet she does not lose composure. <br>She feels no sadness. No worry. She simply stands in place, <br>reading the same scant words over and over and over again.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">After passing through the stonework city, the girl's vision fills with green. <br>The air on her skin feels different somehow. Brisker. She is making her way back to her hometown. <br>A few days earlier, she went to her teacher and revealed the contents of the letter. <br>She told how her mother had taken ill. <br>And she explained that the hospital had asked her to come out so they could go over the issue in person.<br><br>After hearing this, her teacher granted permission for the journey. <br>As the scenery continues to change, the girl begins to recognize more and more of her old home. <br>A sense of nostalgia weighs heavy on her heart. <br>She had been nervous in the days leading up to her departure. <br>So much so that her teacher had given her some kind words as she departed: "Try not to worry. <br>I'm certain everything will be all right. And I know your mother will be thrilled to see you."<br><br>But her mother is the very thing casting the shadow on the girl's heart. Not because she is sick. <br>Oh no. That is not it at all. It is because of what she did. <br>The girl does not think of the woman who birthed her as her mother. To tell the truth, <br>she barely thinks of her at all.  <br>Because she also remembers something else her mother once told her: <br><br>"I wish you had never been born."<br><br>For these reasons, the thought of returning home fills the girl with a quiet, gnawing dread. <br>The closer she gets to her destination, the heavier her legs grow. <br>The image of her mother—so successfully pushed down for so long—begins to <br>take unwelcome root in her mind. And awful memories start roiling in the deepest crevices of her heart. <br>Despite the sunlight beaming down on her, the girl's sweat is cold. <br>The straps of her damp leather bag are stained a dusky brown. <br>The hospital looms before her like a challenge. And her mother awaits inside.<br><br>Trees rustle in the breeze outside the hospital doors. <br>Bright orange fruit hangs heavy from thin branches. <br>The girls stares at it and recalls a time, long ago, when she came here with her mother. <br><i>This fruit was ripe then, too.</i> <br><i>It caught my eye, so I reached out to grab one that had fallen to the ground.</i> <br><i>But when my mother noticed, she smacked me in the hand with her cane.</i> <br><i>I cried. No, I didn't cry. I</i> sobbed<i>.</i> <i>And all my mother could do was glare at me.</i><br><br>A ghostly pain from that long-ago day flashes through the back of her hand, <br>and she quickly shakes it off. She wraps her fingers around the doorknob and pulls it open. <br>An empty reception desk sits sadly in the lobby. Not knowing what else to do, <br>she begins wandering the halls in search of her mother's room. <br>But the rest of the building is as empty as the lobby. <br>The entire hospital stands cold and forgotten, <br>almost as if it is ready to dry up and blow away in the breeze.<br><br>She walks from one hallway to the next, opening doors and peering around corners, <br>but finds only solitude. All that moves in this place are the thin white curtains on the windows. <br>The girl begins to feel as though she has been left behind, and unease wells up inside her. <br>The afternoon is warm. Languid. Tranquil. If the breeze were to stop, <br>there would be no way to tell that time was still passing.<br><br>She makes her way down a long corridor, counting numbers as she goes.<br><br>103, 104, 105, 106...<br>107.<br><br>Her mother's room—or at least the room where she is supposed to be. <br>The girl gently pushes a door that swings on silent hinges and peers into the room. <br>A lone woman sits upright in bed, facing away from her as she gazes out the window. <br>Her mother. Despite the grim news contained in the letter, her posture seems firm. <br>Though her figure seems to have diminished a bit since the girl had seen her last. <br>Or perhaps it is simply that she herself has grown.<br><br>Her imagination begins to whirl. She pictures what her mother will look like <br>when she finally turns around. How she will sound. What she might say. <br>With her head hanging low, she braces herself for whatever is to come. <br><i>It's all right,</i> she thinks. <i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i> <br><i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i> <i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i><br><br>But the girl knows she cannot stand in place forever. She slowly moves forward, <br>sliding her feet across the floor in an attempt to hide their sound.<br><br>One step.<br>......<br>And another.<br>......<br>After another step, her mother starts to rotate her head.<br><br>Another step later and now she is facing her. It is nothing at all like the girl imagined. <br>Her mother's face is calm. After a moment, a childlike expression of glee moves <br>across her features and she begins to speak. "Oh, Grandma! I'm so happy you're here!"</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Gentle sunlight fills the white room. Thin curtains dance on the wind. Alone, <br>the girl and her mother face each other. The older woman's expression is the pure joy of a child. <br>It is so, <i>so</i> different from the image the girl has carried heavy in her memory for all this time. <br>She wonders briefly if this is even her real mother, and the thought makes ice run in her veins.<br><br>The mother of her memory is stern. Cold. Unfeeling. The thought of a smile from such a woman is folly. <br>Even when the girl truly needed help, her mother would turn away and walk off without a word. <br>Never had she reached down to help her up. Not once. But now...<br><br>"I'm sorry," says a sudden voice from behind the girl. She whirls around to find an elderly man clad in <br>a crisp doctor's coat. "I'm sorry I could not be here to meet you in person," he continues. <br>"We've just been so very understaffed lately."<br><br>"Oh, um, that's all right," manages the girl. Before she can say more, the doctor takes a breath and <br>begins to explain her mother's condition. Something had gone terribly wrong with <br>the cognitive functions in her brain, causing her to collapse. She had been discovered in <br>her home a few days prior. But by the time they found her, she was too far gone. <br>Despite the best treatment they could muster, her brain function had not recovered.<br><br>Her state of mind had reverted to that of her own childhood. The more the doctor tells her, <br>the more the girl's mind reels. He seems to sense her discomfort, but his profession demands <br>a certain clinical nature, so he soldiers on. "It is perhaps a bit cruel to say this to a child, <br>but I feel you have the right to know." He takes a breath, then another. <br>"We do not know how much time your mother has left. And if it is possible... <br>We would like you to stay with her until the end."<br><br>He stops talking then and waits. After a pause the length of an age, the girl tells him <br>she will need some time to think. He nods and leaves her alone with her thoughts. <br>And alone with her mother.<br><br>Origami stars and animals are taped to the walls. Balloons hang brightly in one corner. <br>Her mother's room has been decorated like the play area of a child. <br>The girl stares at one of the stars. <i>Did my mother make this? Did she make all of these?</i> <br>Behind her, her mother opens a desk drawer. After a bit of rustling, <br>she pulls out a few sheets of origami paper. "Let's make something!" she cries happily. <br>"I'm so good at it! Come on, please?" She tugs on her daughter's clothing as she speaks.<br><br>The girl can't believe her eyes. Her mother—the same woman to whom a smile was <br>a forbidden thing—was now pleading for attention. It's too much. It's all just too much. <br>With a sudden cry, the girl smacks her mother's hand away. The reaction makes the older <br>woman burst into tears. <i>THIS is who I was afraid of all these years? This pathetic creature?</i> <br>The girl's bewilderment finally gives way to rage.<br><br>Her mother had caused her so much grief. So much pain. And for what purpose? To what end? <br>As she stares at the sobbing thing before her, she wishes it would just hurry up and die. <br><i>Am I a terrible daughter? A terrible person?</i> <br>The girl does not know the answers to these questions; she knows only that <br>she cannot come up with even a single kind word for her mother. So instead she stands in <br>place and listens to the sound of her weeping echo off the stale hospital walls.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The girl sits in a rough wooden chair and stares out the window. Days have passed since the shocking <br>meeting with her mother, and she has yet to fully grasp the reality of the situation. <br>But after speaking with the doctor, it was decided that <br>she would stay at the hospital, at least for a little while. <br>A letter was drafted to explain the circumstances and sent to her school. <br>And against all odds, the doctor's kind and continuous treatment begins to have an effect.<br><br>Her mother's mind begins to age, moving from that of a child to that of an adult. <br>And though it is a strange and bewildering time for the girl, she sits by her mother's side through it all. <br>At first, it seemed as though there was no hope. But after a week, her expression changes. <br>It becomes more mature, and she begins to speak of romance. Over the span of a few weeks, <br>the girl watches her mother gradually grow up. She now has the mental age of a young adult.<br><br>Her mother loved origami as a child. Her mother hated bugs as a teenager. <br>Her mother still hates carrots as an adult. The woman before her is always soft. <br>Always kind. But it is not the sort of kindness a mother shows her daughter.<br><br>One day, her mother awakens in a terrible state. <br>Her voice is the picture of confusion and helplessness. <br>"Stay with me, Grandma! Please stay with me!" The girl meets her mother's gaze calmly. <br>She summons her courage. "Of course," she finally replies. "I'll be right here."<br><br>Her mother has never called her anything but "Grandma." <br>Perhaps, in her mind, she is not even a mother yet. <br>Which means that, in her mind, the girl does not actually exist. All of this lies heavy on the girl's mind. <br><i>I hated my mother.</i> <i>And I thought she hated me.</i> <i>Did I ever want to be close to her?</i> <br><i>And did she ever want to be close to me?</i> But the answers remain always out of reach.<br><br>Another week goes by, and her mother's condition takes a turn for the worse. <br>Her arms are as weak and thin as the branches of the fruit tree outside the hospital. <br>She slips in and out of consciousness. <br>The doctor pulls the girl aside and says he does not expect her to live through the night. <br>So the girl stays by her side through the long dark, <br>holding her wrinkled hand all the while.<br><br>The only light is the dim glow of an indifferent moon. <br>It illuminates her mother's pained expression as she moans in her sleep. <br>Suddenly, her eyelids twitch open. <br>"Do you want some water?" asks the girl. Her mother shakes her head.<br><br>She opens her mouth as if to speak. Something is clearly troubling her. <br>"I have to talk to you, Grandma," she says finally. Though weak, <br>her mature voice carries the air of a childhood secret. <br>The girl merely nods, waiting for her to continue. <br>She begins to speak of children, and how conflicted she is by the idea.<br><br>"I don't want a baby," she says. <i>There it is... <br>There it is.</i> Her mother had never wanted her. Not ever.<br><br>If her mother notices the pained expression and lowered head of her daughter, <br>she pays it no mind and continues to speak. She tells of how she began having problems when <br>she was a young woman. After a while, she finally sought medical help. <br>And in time, she was diagnosed with a mental illness. <br>It was this diagnosis that caused her husband to abandon her. <br>The girl raises her head. She had no idea about this—about <i>any</i> of it.<br><br>She had spent but a short time with her mother, and had not been nearly old enough to <br>understand the truth of complex adult affairs. Even now, the story is so complicated that <br>it threatens to blow away from her at any moment. <br>She talks of how her illness will eat away at her. <br>How it will change her. How it will hurt her and everyone she cares for. <br>She worries abut this. She worries without ceasing or pause.<br><br>If she were to ever have a child, she would surely hurt them as well. Despite how much... <br>Despite how <i>very</i> much... She loves the child that lies inside her now.<br><br>Wet heat drips down the girl's cheeks. It falls to the floor like slow rain. <br>As she listens to her mother's confession, the girl's anger and hatred finally begin to <br>escape her body in the form of small drops at the corners of her eyes.<br><br>Finally, her mother sighs and lays back. She closes her eyes. <br>Every worry of a life—every worry of a million lifetimes—seems to have contained itself <br>in the dark circles beneath her eyes. The room grows silent as the girl squeezes her hand. <br>And for the first time since she came to the hospital... <br>For the first time in so long, she says... "Mom."<br><br>Dawn breaks after an endless night. It is the girl's birthday. <br>Bright, cheerful sunlight pours over her hometown. <br>The girl blocks it out with one unsteady hand as she stares out the window. <br>She has changed since she came here. Grown. <br>Matured. Today, the girl's birthday will be celebrated in the form of a farewell. <br>She dons a pure white dress of mourning...and prepares to see her mom for the very last time.</p>
