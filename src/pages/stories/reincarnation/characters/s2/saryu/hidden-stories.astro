<p class="title">Chapter 1: Rumors (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">"Feeling good about the<br>upcoming test?”<br><br>I turned to see my best friend<br>running up behind me as I<br>hurried to the arcane-<br>experiments room. His hair<br>was as unruly as ever,<br>shooting out and away from<br>his head as if it desired to<br>enter orbit.<br><br>"Are you really asking me<br>that question? As I recall,<br>I scored much higher than<br>you on the last one."<br><br>"Yeah, yeah. But I'm going<br>to make up for it this time!"<br><br>"You'd better, because this<br>is just getting embarrassing."<br><br>We had bantered like this<br>since the first day we met<br>in the hallowed halls of the<br>magick academy. Each<br>semester we challenged<br>each other to see who<br>could score higher on the<br>endless series of tests we<br>were given, and each<br>semester he somehow<br>managed to keep up with me.<br><br>I always found this fact<br>supremely annoying, because<br>I didn't see how he could<br>possibly pull off such high<br>scores while also being<br>a complete slacker. <br><br>This semester's contest was<br>currently deadlocked at five<br>wins each, and I'd sworn to<br>study even harder so I could<br>pull away from him before<br>things came to a close. <br><br>Fortunately, the next test<br>was in my best subject,<br>so I felt confident I would<br>be able to seal the deal. <br><br>When I reached the<br>experiments room, I found<br>my classmates buzzing about<br>in preparation for the practical<br>exam. Our test today was all<br>about transmutation: changing<br>a thing of one substance into<br>another. It was a tricky<br>problem that required a number<br>of delicate, subtle skills;<br>students who simply attacked<br>it with raw magickal strength<br>would quickly find their efforts<br>ending in failure.<br> <br>As the other students pulled<br>out their various ores and<br>plants, I slowly reached into<br>my bag and removed a<br>sleepy frog. I knew it was<br>a risky move—frogs are<br>notoriously hard to<br>transmute—but if I could<br>pull it off, I'd certainly have<br>the final win I was looking for.<br><br>I set the frog on my desk<br>and began casting my spell.<br>Light flowed from my staff<br>and swirled around the<br>animal, who seemed merely<br>bored by the proceedings.<br>As I worked, I began to form<br>an image of the transmuted<br>shape I was aiming for,<br>being careful not to add too<br>much or too little magick.<br>I felt good. Confident.<br>Almost cocky.<br><br>But then everything went<br>wrong.<br><br>The magick I thought I'd<br>conquered suddenly yanked<br>against the reins, and the<br>slow trickle of power became<br>a surging waterfall. A million<br>different colors of light blazed<br>across the walls as my staff<br>began to shake in my hands.<br><br>"Let go!” cried my professor<br>as she ran toward my station.<br>When I hesitated a fraction of<br>a second, she slammed her<br>hands on the desk and<br>screamed again. "NOW!”<br><br>The moment I released my<br>grip on the staff, the other<br>classmates begin to scream.<br>The staff floated higher into<br>the air, whirling like a<br>maddened dervish as it poured<br>more and more magick into the<br>now very-much-concerned frog.<br>The poor creature began to grow,<br>swelling into the size of a<br>watermelon, then a small dog,<br>then a human. Skin stretched.<br>Eyes bulged. Screams rang<br>out anew.<br><br>And then...it exploded. <br><br>That was three days ago,<br>and needless to say,<br>I did not win the grade contest<br>with my best friend. But honestly,<br>I have much bigger issues on my<br>mind right now—like the fact I've<br>suddenly lost the ability to<br>control even the smallest<br>magickal spell.  <br><br>As I hurry toward my room with<br>my head hanging low, I hear<br>students whispering behind me<br>in the stairwell.<br><br>"Hey, did you hear about the<br>exploding frog thing?”<br><br>"I know—it's SO disgusting!<br>Apparently they were cleaning<br>gunk off the walls for hours.”<br><br>"Yeah, but do you know who's<br>responsible?”<br><br>I hear a giggle, then a whisper<br>that sounds suspiciously<br>like my name, and I suddenly<br>want nothing more than to find<br>a nice, warm hole to crawl into<br>and live in forever.<br><br>"So sad—she used to be<br>pretty talented. Hey, do you think<br>it's that Omen thing? The one that<br>makes you unable to use magic?"<br><br>"I dunno, but I heard one of the<br>older kids say that same thing."<br><br>I knew exactly what they were<br>talking about—we all did.<br>Rumors of the Omen had been<br>swirling around the school since<br>the day we arrived:<br><br><i>A magick user's power is never<br>more unstable than in the days<br>leading up to their tenth birthday.<br><br>And if they cannot gain control<br>over it before the full moon rises<br>in the sky, they will never be<br>able to use their power again.</i><br><br>I laughed it off when I first heard<br>about it—we all did. But right<br>now, laughing was the furthest<br>thing from my mind. Because<br>I'd celebrated my tenth birthday<br>just a few days ago, and now<br>there was only a week left<br>until the next full moon.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: The Library's Keeper (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">Five days until the full moon...<br><br>The thought of losing my<br>magic terrifies me. But as<br>I sit motionless in the<br>classroom and try not to<br>consider this possibility,<br>my best friend wanders<br>over and begins our<br>usual banter.<br><br>"Aw, you look down.<br>Did losing to me make<br>you that sad?"<br><br>Usually, I'd let such snarky<br>comments go. But this time,<br>I get up and storm off<br>without a word—because<br>I know he’ll just laugh if<br>I tell him what I’m thinking.<br><br>Eventually, I make my way<br>to the library and take a<br>moment to breathe in the<br>atmosphere. Bookshelves<br>scrape the ceiling, while<br>haphazard shelf placement<br>makes it less organized than<br>an ancient maze. If I’m going<br>to find a clue—if there’s<br>some way to undo the curse<br>that haunts me—I’m going<br>to find it here.<br><br><i>Not this one.<br>This is no good<br>Nope. Not this one either.</i><br><br>I’m concentrating so hard on<br>finding my book, I don’t even<br>realize that I’m lost. And when<br>I finally recognize that fact,<br>I’m so startled that I take an<br>involuntary step backward and<br>collide with a bookshelf—which<br>immediately spins on its axis<br>and sends me crashing<br>through a revolving door.<br> <br>I am floating.<br><br>Slowly, I force my eyes open<br>and see that several of the<br>tomes which had fallen from<br>the shelf are drifting gently<br>in front of me.<br><br>Somehow—some <i>way</i>—the<br>books and I are slowly falling<br>down, down, down an endless<br>hallway lined as far as the eye<br>can see with shelves.<br><br>I don’t know if there is a bottom.<br>Or a top. Heck, maybe I’ll just<br>float like this until thirst and<br>starvation take me.<br><br>But then, someone speaks.<br><br>"TELL ME THY NAME."<br><br>"Sorry, but where are you?<br>And, um, <i>who</i> are you?"<br>I try to put some force into my<br>voice to hide my fear, but it all<br>falls apart at the end. <br><br>"I AM THE KEEPER OF<br>THE LIBRARY."<br><br>"Oh. That’s, um...I’ve never<br>heard of you."<br><br>"THOU HAST INTRUDED UPON<br>MY DOMAIN, AND NOW MUST<br>ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS<br>TRUE. IF THINE ANSWERS<br>SATISFY ME, I SHALL GRANT<br>THY MOST CHERISED DESIRE."<br><br>I have to be careful here—<br><i>incredibly</i> careful. The first<br>thing they teach you when you<br>arrive at the academy is to be<br>wary of powerful mages.<br>There’s strength in their<br>questions, you see...and penalties<br>if you lie. But I also know this is<br>my best—and maybe only—chance<br>to find the answers I need.<br><br>"All right, then. Ask away."<br><br>"WHAT STRIKES THE GREATEST<br>FEAR IN THY HEART?"<br><br>"My greatest fear? Um, well,<br>I suppose I'm afraid of<br>disappointing my teachers."<br><br><i>Sort of a boring answer,<br>but also very much true.</i><br><br>"IN WHAT DOST THOU PLACE<br>THE MOST TRUST?"<br><br>"My own power."<br><br><i>I mean, I came to a floating<br>hallway to keep it, so I’d better<br>trust it.</i><br> <br>"THY FINAL QUESTION COMES."<br><br>I try to swallow, but my throat<br>might as well be made of sand.<br><br>"WHAT IS MOST PRECIOUS<br>TO THEE?"<br><br>"Most precious? That'd be my..."<br><br>"Magick" is what I want to say.<br>Magick. I mean, of <i>course</i> it’s<br>my magick. But for some reason my<br>mind decides this is a great time<br>to go running off on its own,<br>and I hear myself say:<br><br>"My family."<br><br>Oh god. Oh no. I’m in real trouble<br>now. I feel my body come to<br>a halt and reverse direction,<br>meaning I’m now floating UP.<br>Expecting some kind of horrible<br>punishment, I squeeze myself<br>into the smallest ball I can and<br>shut my eyes tight. But then... <br><br>"THAT ANSWER HAS SAVED<br>THY LIFE."<br><br>The next thing I know, I’m<br>standing in the library entrance.<br>At my feet is a book I'd never<br>seen, flipped open to a page<br>for a potion that enhances<br>a person’s magickal ability.<br><br>Was I dreaming?<br><i>Am</i> I dreaming?<br><br>A weird feeling settles over me<br>as I look around at the library.<br>I expect something strange—<br>something higher—but all<br>I see before me is the same,<br>quiet space I have so come<br>to love.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: The Stone Giant (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Two days until the full moon.<br><br>I've been busy collecting<br>ingredients for my magick-<br>enhancement elixir ever since<br>I found that tome in the<br>library. I feel myself losing<br>strength by the day, and I'm<br>panicking. I have to do<br>whatever it takes to secure<br>the ingredients by the night<br>of the full moon.<br><br>Currently, I'm slogging my way<br>through a dark forest ripe<br>with magick, collecting the<br>various items I need. When my<br>satchel is finally filled to<br>bursting with a supply of<br>herbs, I turn to leave and<br>notice a little butterfly<br>hovering around me.<br><br><i>Have I seen this<br>butterfly before?</i><br><br>The front side of its gray<br>wings glow faintly. I count<br>one butterfly, then another,<br>then another. Soon the<br>creatures blanket my entire<br>vision, so I swipe my hand<br>through them to clear a path.<br><br>"Ow!"<br><br>The sudden voice makes me<br>jump, and I whirl around in<br>an attempt to find the source.<br><br>"Pffft! This kid has no idea<br>who's talking."<br><br>"Yeah, she seems like a real<br>dum-dum, all right!"<br><br>Laughter ripples out before<br>me in waves, and I suddenly<br>realize the source of the<br>voices are the butterflies<br>themselves. At that moment,<br>I remember where I'd seen<br>them: a textbook I was<br>glancing at back at school.<br>These are no normal insects,<br>but instead beautiful, cruel<br>creatures that feed on the<br>darkest parts of the human<br>heart. And if you inhale<br>their scales, you are<br>subjected to an increasingly<br>horrible series of illusions.<br><br>"This isn't a place for<br>a loser like you."<br><br>"Aww, did that make you feel<br>bad? It's true, though,<br>you useless little witch." <br><br>After a theatric series of<br>insults, the butterflies<br>gather in one spot, almost as<br>if they are a single organism.<br>They then take the shape of a<br>human—one I know all too well.<br><br>"I'm disappointed in you.<br>A witch without magick has no<br>value to anyone."<br><br>It's my alchemy professor,<br>and while I know it isn't<br>real, it looks and sounds<br>exactly like the actual thing.<br>As I stare in horror, the<br>insects transform into<br>classmates, villagers, and<br>friends, each one pelting me<br>with horrible statements.<br><br>And then... <br><br>"What's got you looking<br>so miserable?"<br><br>It's the boy—my best friend. <br><br>"No... Not this..."<br><br>"You've always been ugly,<br>you know that? Plus, you're<br>always arguing with me over<br>one thing or another. Still,<br>you've got good grades, which<br>is why I keep pretending to<br>be your friend."<br><br>My eyes fill up with tears.<br>He would never say something<br>like this to me. <i>Never.</i><br>And yet, what if he's been<br>thinking such things all this<br>time and never told me?<br><br>"But without magick? Useless.<br>Just another dumb little<br>witch. So...bye."<br><br>I let out a strangled cry and<br>reach for him, then stop<br>myself. This isn't real—these<br>are just creatures taking his<br>form in an attempt to eat my<br>heart. And even if he <i>did</i><br>think such things... <br><br>"I won't lose to you!"<br><br>I grip my staff and attempt<br>to launch a fireball, but am<br>rewarded with a tiny poof and<br>a pathetic spark instead.<br>Was this actually happening?<br>Was my magick really so weak?<br>My best friend cackles madly<br>at my shocked expression,<br>then slowly dissolves into a<br>mass of swarming butterflies.<br>But just before he fades<br>completely, he gives one last<br>twist of the knife: <br><br>"There's no place for you here.<br>There's no place <i>anywhere</i>."</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: The Stone Giant (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Tonight is the first night of<br>the full moon since my 10th<br>birthday—the last chance to<br>get my magick back before I<br>lose it forever.<br><br>Warm rays of sunset light beam<br>through the window, guiding me<br>as I walk through the dusty<br>corridor. Suddenly, I hear the<br>horrible sound of stone<br>scraping on stone behind me,<br>and realize I've found what I<br>came for.<br><br><i>Got you.</i><br><br>The potion recipe in my book<br>said I needed to secure the<br>heart of a massive stone golem<br>before nightfall, and I'd come<br>to this crumbling manor to<br>find one. Suppressing my<br>overwhelming desire to run,<br>I reach into one of the hidden<br>pockets of my robe and withdraw<br>a small arcane pearl I'd<br>created for this very moment.<br><br>"I'll see you in hell, buddy!"<br>I scream as I hurl the object<br>into the oncoming creature.<br>There is a bright flash of<br>light, followed by a deep<br>rumble that echoes throughout<br>the manor. But then...<br><br>"Oh. That's not good at all."<br><br>When the smoke clears, the<br>golem is unharmed—my precious<br>pearl didn't even slow it<br>down. As my legs begin to<br>tremble, it presses me up<br>against a wall with its<br>massive bulk. Its eyes peer<br>down at me from the ceiling,<br>questioning, unblinking.<br>Then it raises one enormous<br>hand and prepares to bring it<br>down, ending my life as a tiny<br>little splat on the floor that<br>no one will even recognize<br>come the morning.<br><br>"This way!"<br><br>As a familiar voice cries out,<br>a bolt of lightning knocks the<br>golem's killing blow aside.<br>I turn in wonderment to see<br>the boy standing there—my best<br>friend. As I dash past the<br>grumbling golem and to his<br>side, he casts another powerful<br>spell at my enemy.<br><br>"I'm barely slowing this<br>damn thing down!"<br><br>I know that, just as I know<br>there's only one way out of<br>this: I'll tell him to run and<br>save himself while I distract<br>the creature. But before I can<br>speak this plan aloud, he holds<br>his staff out and blesses me<br>with a familiar crooked smile.<br><br>"Here," he says in a low voice.<br>"Hold my staff. We'll hit this <br>jerk with a combined spell<br>like we learned in class!"<br> <br>"No! I can't! I can't use<br>magick anymore!"<br><br>No sense in trying to hide it<br>anymore; the cat is not only<br>out of the bag, it's running<br>off down the road. I expect<br>him to turn and leave in a<br>cloud of disgust when I say<br>this, but to my astonishment,<br>his smile just grows wider.<br><br>"Wrong! You're an <i>amazing</i><br>spellcaster! You just have to<br>trust in yourself. Now get<br>ready, because that ugly<br>thing's coming right for us!"<br><br>His voice sparks a mad sense<br>of encouragement in me, and<br>almost without realizing it,<br>I reach out and grip the<br>staff. Moments later, a<br>whirlpool of light spills out<br>of his weapon. A gust of wind<br>whips up, threatening to blow<br>me away. And as I stand in the<br>swirling light, I feel my body<br>being filled with magick.<br><br><i>Oh my god...<br>This is incredible!</i><br><br>This is our magick; our powers<br>intermingling to make a storm<br>of unimaginable ferocity.<br>The roof detaches and soars<br>away. Walls crumble. Pillars<br>explode. And at the end of it<br>all, the once-mighty golem is<br>nothing but a heap of rocks<br>on the floor. <br><br>"How did you know I was here?"<br>I ask as I dust myself off.<br><br>"You'd been acting weird<br>lately, so I peeked at your<br>notes and saw something about<br>creating an elixir, as well<br>as the location of this<br>place." He pauses for a moment<br>to dislodge a small pebble<br>from his shoulder, then looks <br>at me again. "Say, do you<br>remember what our professor<br>said about mages and witches<br>having really unstable magick<br>at the age of ten?"<br><br>"What?" <br><br>"Yeah, that whole thing about<br>us 'losing our magick' is just<br>a superstition, but it's based<br>around the fact stuff tends to<br>run amok at this age."<br> <br>As his words settle over me,<br>I realize my magick worked<br>perfectly fine when we cast<br>the combined spell. "So,<br>um... You knew I was upset<br>about all of this?"<br><br>"Yeah, and I was worried." <br><br>His voice is both gentle and<br>warm, and I have to resist a<br>sudden urge to burst into<br>tears as I hear it. Shame<br>rises in my heart as I realize<br>how stupid it was to think<br>this friend might have<br>abandoned me if I lost my<br>magick, when the whole time<br>he was more concerned about<br>me than I ever imagined. <br><br>"Um, thanks," I manage as I<br>pull my hat low over my eyes.<br>I don't want him to see me<br>like this, but he just bursts<br>out laughing. <br><br>"Hey, of course!<br>You're family, after all." <br><br><i>Family.</i> Though I'm happy to<br>hear him use that word, I'm<br>not exactly sure how to feel<br>about it.<br><br>"Hey, so let's get out of<br>here, yeah?"<br><br>"Yes. Let's."<br><br>As we walk home beneath a<br>shimmering full moon,<br>I deliberately take slower<br>steps than necessary, all so<br>the moment might last just<br>a little bit longer.</p>

<p class="para">She's such a hardworking girl.<br><br>She was raised in a school for budding magick users,<br>and ended up with top marks in her class. It sounds like<br>her friends relied on her a lot to make sure they passed<br>all their various tests. <br><br>And yes, she's stubborn and a sore loser—and also seems<br>cursed with unusually poor luck. But she's a good kid<br>on the inside, so people like her. <br><br>I mean, she works with people to help set up festivals,<br>sends cookies to folks on their birthdays, and even<br>sneaks off school grounds on occasion. Also, I hear<br>there's one friend in particular who is slowly becoming<br>very special to her. Ooo la la!<br><br>Ah, school life. It almost makes me want to go back and<br>experience it all over again. Still, I have to wonder why<br>earnest and hardworking kids like her always seem to<br>end up with the most tragic fates...</p>
