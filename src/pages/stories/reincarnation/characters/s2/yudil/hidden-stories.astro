<p class="title">Chapter 1: The Boy and Prince - Meeting (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">The chaotic hum of people.<br><br>The annoying buzz of insect wings. <br><br>The sun hanging high above the harbor.<br><br>The scent of sweat and seafood wafting through the air. <br><br>I dig through a pile of garbage on the side of the street<br>and soon emerge with the leftover bones of a fried fish.<br>And even though it smells of trash and wet and rot,<br>it tastes like a meal fit for royalty to me. <br><br>I feel shame for my scavenging, of course, but it's<br>a far more human existence than the life of slavery<br>I led several months earlier. <br><br>And more human than the subhuman treatment<br>I experienced back on that ship. <br><br>A few bones aren't enough to keep me alive—a fact to which<br>my growling stomach can testify. But without a cent to my<br>name, I've no choice but to steal the leavings of others or<br>hope someone throws a few charitable coins at a starving<br>ten-year-old child.<br><br>But such coins are few and far between. If nothing changes,<br>I'll starve to death by the side of the road. I know this.<br><br>And only my own strength and skill can change it.<br><br>The strength to live. <br><br>The skill to survive. <br><br>If I don't find some kind of work—any kind—I'm going to die.<br>I understand this logically, but it doesn't make the way<br>forward any clearer.<br><br>A few days later, I look up from the gutter where I spent<br>the night and see a boy my age, or perhaps a bit younger.<br>He's running through the streets in finely tailored,<br>expensive clothes, showing he's of a birth vastly different<br>to mine, and even to the comparatively wealthy<br>merchants of the harbor.<br><br>At first, I think the boy is frantically searching for<br>something, but when a pack of ruffians appears at the<br>other end of the street, I realize he's running. It's clearly<br>a kidnapping attempt; the ruffians are dressed too fine<br>to bother with a mere mugging.<br><br>All of it is a mess that has nothing to do with me, and<br>I have no desire to get caught up in it. But when I go to<br>hide, my eyes meet the boy's. His expression widens,<br>as though an idea has suddenly come to him, and he<br>races towards me with an almost inhuman speed.<br><br>I can tell right away that nothing about this is good,<br>but before I can even act, he seizes my hand and begins<br>pulling me down the street. <br><br>"Let's get out of here," he whispers.<br><br>So he runs, and I am dragged along behind. <br><br>I don't understand—and the men in pursuit appear equally<br>bewildered by the development. But the boy does not care;<br>he keeps a firm grasp on my hand and runs, like a knight<br>pulling his princess far away from the enemy. <br><br>We dart to and fro throughout the labyrinthine city,<br>and though I trip over myself countless times,<br>he always manages to drag me along.<br><br>We tear freshly washed linens down from lines and stretch<br>them into makeshift barricades. We grab handfuls of fish<br>from seafood stalls and throw them to the ground, making<br>it slippery beneath the ruffians' feet. The boy is filled<br>with all kinds of inane tactics to avoid capture, and all<br>I can do is follow along as best I can.<br><br>Finally, we emerge at the edge of town. The men have lost<br>our trail, and we are safe. But after putting on such a<br>show, there is no way we can return to the city. <br><br>"What the hell is wrong with you?" I wheeze, at last asking<br>the question I should have posited at the beginning.<br>My breath is short and my stomach empty, but exhaustion<br>keeps my anger at a dull roar. In response, however,<br>the boy only maintains his grip on my hand. <br><br>"Apologies," he says. "I'm sorry I had to do that.<br>But I am the prince of a distant land."<br><br>His expression seems...invigorated, somehow. And as I<br>look at him and see a face that somehow remains beautiful<br>despite being covered in sweat and dust, I understand he is<br>not lying.<br><br>And on the heels of that, I understand I have gotten myself<br>into a mess far greater than I ever could have imagined.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: The Boy and Prince - Theft (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">A boy who called himself a prince was being chased by rough-<br>looking men. For some reason, he reached out to grab me—<br>a beggar and stranger—as he made his escape from the city. <br><br>"If you're really a prince," I ask once we reach the<br>outskirts of the city, "then why are you being chased<br>all by yourself? Where are your royal guards?"<br><br>The boy begins to explain his circumstances. He was <br>traveling with his father when a band of outlaws kidnapped<br>him. Their plan was to hold him for ransom, but he<br>eventually managed to slip free of their grasp. He knew,<br>however, that he would need help to evade his captors<br>for any length of time, and that was when he found me.<br><br>"All well and good," I say. "But why <i>me</i>?"<br><br>The supposed prince looks at me with sharp eyes,<br>"I picked someone who seemed kind—someone who looked <br>like they would listen to my story and agree to help."<br><br>I feel stunned. Sure, I used to be a slave, so I probably<br>look pretty easy to order around. That part makes sense.<br>But when he found me, I was digging through a filthy trash<br>heap—and what about that told him I would be <i>kind</i>? <br><br>I may not have an especially high opinion of myself,<br>but this prince is clearly delusional. I mean, I have<br>absolutely nothing to offer.<br><br>Sensing my lack of motivation, the prince quickly informs<br>me that an official notice had been issued in his home<br>country. His worried father—the king—has proclaimed that<br>any who bring his son back will be rewarded handsomely. <br><br>I stop to think about that. A bit of coin <i>would</i> be appreciated;<br>at the very least, I could bid farewell to my days of<br>digging for scraps in the trash. But I also don't want<br>things to change <i>too</i> much. Yes, I want money,<br>but not if it comes at the cost of my freedom.<br><br>Before I can argue or resist further, however, the prince<br>firmly grips my hand.<br> <br>"It'll be more than worth your while," he says. "Let's go." <br><br>Having made up my mind for me, the prince begins pulling<br>me along. I realize I can slip free and run if I want,<br>but I don't. Instead, I just follow behind him in a daze.<br>Maybe my dulled mind is thinking only of survival.<br>Or maybe I just don't have the balls to turn him down.<br><br>Either way, the two of us will be alone until we reach the<br>castle. It's a precarious situation, and hunger is quickly<br>going to become a concern. So imagine my surprise when<br>he leads me to a market and says these words:<br><br>"Let's steal something from here." <br><br>Is that a joke? It sure doesn't <i>sound</i> like a joke,<br>so maybe this prince has a stronger will to survive that<br>I do. Yet at the same time, I feel a wave of excitement<br>wash over me when I hear the word "steal." Even at my<br>lowest point, when I was searching through the garbage<br>for food, I never imagined I might lower myself to this.<br><br>"We're going to steal food first," says the prince.<br>"You stay here."<br><br>He turns away from my flustering self and wanders over<br>to a nearby stall. I stand behind the corner of a building,<br>watching him elude the stallkeeper's gaze as he boldly<br>snatches up two fruits and hides them in his clothes.<br>He then returns to me with a nonchalant expression<br>plastered on his face.<br><br>"See? Easy." <br><br>He beams as he hands me my share. He seems to feel no guilt<br>at all—if anything, the air around him seems even more noble.<br>I don't understand any of it, and I sure as hell don't<br>comprehend what he's thinking. All I know is that this whole<br>"stealing" thing seems far easier than I'd first assumed,<br>and that I can likely pull it off if I just follow his lead.<br><br>"Okay," I say. "I'll give it a shot."<br><br>I wander back to the stall, waiting for the stallkeeper's <br>attention to waiver. The moment it does, I mimic the speed<br>and smoothness of the prince's movement and grab an<br>especially juicy piece of fruit. <br><br>It looks good. ...Maybe too good. <br><br>The moment my fingers brush the skin of the fruit, saliva<br>fills my mouth and my stomach lets out a loud rumble.<br>Hearing the sound, the stallkeeper whips around to find<br>me staring up at him with wide eyes.<br><br>"What are you doing!?" he screams as he raises a<br>cooking knife above his head. <br><br>Panicked, I race back to where the prince is hiding.<br>He understands instantly what is happening, grabbing my<br>hand and sending us racing off across the city again as<br>fast as our feet can carry us.<br><br><i>I'm like a helpless princess, aren't I?</i><br><br>It's an amusing thought, especially since it arrives as<br>a crazed man with a knife is chasing me through the city.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Boy and Prince - Last Night (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">I'm traveling aimlessly with a self-styled prince. It's<br>been some time since I first sullied my hands with theft.<br><br>Our best clothes are torn and reduced to tatters—<br>we're practically half-naked at this point.<br><br>And yet, we can't stop laughing and smiling. His noble blood<br>drives his optimism, and his brilliance is almost blinding.<br><br>Our journey felt like an eternity, but according to him, we<br>were quickly approaching the borders of his home country.<br><br>It certainly helped that our teamwork grew tighter by<br>the day.<br><br>Our teamwork in what, exactly? Stealing, of course.<br><br>Even in towns we happen upon on the road, our strategy<br>has rarely failed us.<br><br>He would first stand in the city square and declare in a<br>loud, clear voice: "Come one, come all! I am a traveling<br>dancer. Behold my dance from a city far to the west."<br><br>He would then raise his arms, roll his belly, and begin<br>his dance. He'd use his rags as a veil over his face.<br><br>He told me he was mimicking a dancer he once saw<br>perform before the throne.<br><br>Even those who were familiar with the style found it unique.<br>Attention would be drawn, and people would soon crowd<br>around.<br><br>Before long, a mass was gathered around him.<br><br>So, of course, nobody would pay any mind to someone brushing<br>up against them—they were focused entirely on the prince.<br><br>Could a thief ask for a better hunting ground?<br><br>I swam my way through the crowd. Eventually, I came to<br>know at a simple glance where someone kept their wallet.<br><br>A wallet here, a coin purse there, I quickly lightened<br>their loads. The price of admission for a quick moment<br>of entertainment: whatever was on their person.<br><br>"Nothing in life is free" was likely to become a common<br>adage anywhere we went.<br><br>After making a king's ransom, the prince stopped his dance,<br>taking in the thunderous applause and then leaving with<br>a wave.<br><br>We'd hurry off before the people realized how light their<br>pockets suddenly felt. We left town and walked until the<br>town was little more than a speck on the horizon.<br><br>Easy money.<br><br>That first time we tried to steal and failed so miserably<br>felt like a lifetime ago.<br><br>We cheated people out of their money wherever we went, and<br>eventually, we spotted the prince's castle in the distance.<br><br>This marked the last night of our journey. We found a storage<br>shed alongside the road and decided to rest there.<br><br>It was so small that we lay flush with one another.<br><br>I couldn't move from the exhaustion and drowsiness, but he<br>couldn't contain his excitement. He was more optimistic than<br>ever, and he wore a bright smile on his face.<br><br>"Are you that happy to return to the castle?" I ask.<br><br>He shakes his head. "I just remembered a story my aunt<br>read to me once."<br><br>It was the tale of a famous thief.<br><br>The thief had committed a great crime and was cast away to<br>a distant island. But there, he met a beautiful woman.<br><br>The thief and the woman worked together to return to his<br>country, and there he atoned for his sins, and the two lived<br>happily ever after.<br><br>"Sounds familiar, doesn't it?" he says bashfully.<br><br>I give a little snort. <br><br>We certainly qualify as thieves, yes, but he's hardly<br>committed any grave crimes. The similarities were<br>superficial at best.<br><br>Besides, it's hard to imagine myself playing the part of<br>the beautiful woman.<br><br>Then again, I do remember him taking my hand and running.<br><br>"I'm not that pretty," I say. <br><br>"But you have such a beautiful face," he says with an<br>earnest look.<br><br>I can't find the will to argue. I simply let sleep take me.<br><br>In my dream, I become something so shameful that I can<br>never tell another soul about it.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Boy and Prince - Diff Paths (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">I decide to see the wayward prince returned to his castle.<br>At long last, this aimless journey will come to an end.<br>Having committed countless acts of thievery so that I might<br>survive the trip, all I will have to show for the time I spent<br>with the prince is the technique of a practiced burglar.<br><br>He, on the other hand, manages to maintain a regal air<br>despite it all—he is made of the right stuff to rule over<br>others, I'll give him that much.<br><br>Clad in tattered garments, he strolls up to the castle gates<br>and announces his presence. The news quickly spreads<br>from the soldiers posted at the gates to the king himself,<br>who comes dashing from within his citadel in short order.<br><br>His face beaming, the king scoops up the prince in a tight<br>embrace, and the prince happily returns the kindness.<br>The touching reunion of a long-separated father and son...<br>It doesn't do much for me, but if this were some cradle tale<br>I imagine this would be one of its most thrilling moments.<br><br>After a time, the prince peels himself away from his sire<br>and points a finger in my direction. "I wouldn't have survived<br>my journey without them. I'd see them rewarded somehow,"<br>the prince smiles as he makes this wish of his father.<br><br>I watch this exchange while uttering not a single word,<br>and as the king stares in my direction I notice the expression<br>on his face take a turn for the ominous. Next thing I know,<br>the king violently seizes me by my collar and starts yelling.<br><br>"You filthy imp! I bet you're the troublemaker who abducted<br>my boy in the first place!" Shouting this, the king pushes me<br>with such force that I fall onto my rear.<br><br>Thinking the prince must be aghast to see someone to whom<br>he owes such a debt mistreated so, I cast a glance in his<br>direction and... Hm? He watches the exchange between<br>his father and myself with a look of remarkable dispassion.<br>This look on the prince's face goes unnoticed by his father<br>the king as well.<br><br>"Come on inside, my son. Have yourself a long bath and then<br>let's get you changed." The king embraces the prince yet again<br>before moving to lead him into the castle.<br><br>It happens in that moment. Looking over his father's shoulder,<br>he flashes me a wry smile, for we both know that in my hand<br>rests a golden bracelet adorned with gorgeous gemstones.<br><br>As the king turned to shout at me the prince seized the<br>opportunity to avail the king of the bracelet, and then tossed<br>it my way just as the king was turning to face him again.<br>A brilliant bit of work, really.<br><br>I'm no slouch myself, of course—I managed to snag a ring<br>as I was being pushed back—but I take a moment to think<br>on the incredible skills we've learned throughout our long<br>journey together. Having come this far, I can't help but feel<br>the whole thing had been preordained—that our meeting that<br>day was fate, and there could have been no other path for me.<br><br>Skills to live... Skills to survive. Everything that has happened<br>since meeting him in that port town and shaped me into the<br>person I am now. Back then I was but a trapped princess<br>waiting for the sweet release of death... But now? Now, I've<br>acquired the strength I need to survive on this earth.<br><br>...My mind is made up. I'm going to make my way as a thief.<br>I mean, think of that brilliant play the prince made taking that<br>bracelet from the king. I've done all sorts of things like that<br>during my time at his side. A confidence that tells me I have<br>what it takes to make my way in this world has taken root<br>in my chest.<br><br>This journey has given me a much greater reward than<br>anything some king could give me. Hiding my new treasures<br>beneath my garments, I turn on my heel and quickly leave<br>the castle, not even stopping to take a look at the prince's<br>face one last time.<br><br>He and I share a secret now, and we will walk our own paths.<br>From here on out, I am alone...but the skills that now inhabit<br>every fiber of my being come from experiences we shared,<br>and those will live on forever.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: A Style of Thievery (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">"He was originally born to a real good family, I hear.<br>But he was kidnapped by traffickers when he was young and<br>basically lived as a slave. Heard that was 'cause he was<br>bought by an awful master, but he managed to escape and<br>then lived his life as a thief. All alone in a land he was dragged<br>to... He did what he had to do to survive, y'know. But I bet he<br>was a good kid, deep down. He only stole what he had to.<br>And only from the filthy rich. I guess that's the style he settled<br>on. That's what I think, anyway."<br><br>"Uh... I'm sorry, who are you?"<br><br>"What? It's me. You know me!<br>...Wait a second, where'd my mustache go?"</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: The Sailor's Tales 1 (No.06)</p>
<p class="para">People speak of a mountain that lies far north of here—<br>one that's said to house precious gems and jewels of all<br>different colors and sizes. Rumor, you say? Legend?<br>Ah, but I know it's true, for I once went to the mountain<br>to dig up some of the gems for myself.<br><br>I wanted to sell them, of course, but no matter how much<br>I dug, I found nothing. I dug and dug from sunup to sundown⁠,<br>but still nothing. Was it a scam? Or had all the jewels been<br>mined already? Finally, I gave up and looked to the sky—<br>which was absolutely <i>filled</i> with stars. It was so beautiful,<br>all my weariness just melted away.<br><br>Suddenly, I heard a whistle and a thud. A star had fallen!<br>And when I picked it up, I realized it was a gem shining<br>brightly in my hand! At that signal, all the stars⁠—all the<br>gems—began falling one after the other, and all I could<br>think of was collecting them. I was going to be rich!<br><br>I laughed and laughed...and then I heard a loud rumble.<br>I looked up, and would you believe it? The entire <i>moon</i> was<br>threatening to fall on me! It was way too big for me to<br>take, so I ran out of there as fast as I could. And in my<br>panic... Oops! I dropped all the jewels I'd collected.<br><br>――――The princess did not smile.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 7: The Sailor's Tales 40 (No.07)</p>
<p class="para">I was on an island full of ferocious beasts because I'd<br>heard tell of a very rich man who wanted nothing more in<br>life than the pelt of one of those unique creatures.<br><br>My friends were already gone, swallowed by monsters whose<br>teeth were impossibly huge, whose claws were impossibly<br>sharp. I was the only one left; I'd escaped into a cave by<br>the skin of my teeth. The only light I had was the flicker<br>of a candle stub I'd thought to bring, but I proceeded<br>deeper inside all the same.<br><br>It was warm. Humid. Sour. The ground was spongy, and the<br>more I quickened my steps, the more my instincts screamed<br>that something was terribly wrong.<br><br>Oh, and they were right, for it turned out the cave was the<br>inside of an enormous serpent! Now, the fact I stand before<br>you today clearly means I managed to make my escape.<br>But because I slipped my grisly fate and exited the living<br>cave, none of the other beasts would come near me.<br><br>And do you know why?<br><br>――――The princess did not smile.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 8: The Sailor's Hearsay 79 (No.08)</p>
<p class="para">Let me recall for you a tale I heard on a voyage.<br>In the mansion a distinguished, wealthy man, there<br>was a bizarre instrument that'd play music all by itself.<br>That's right—despite there being no one there playing it,<br>it would make noise all the same. And that wasn't the<br>only odd thing about it, either. Anyone who heard<br>the music it made...would fall asleep on the spot!<br>Catching wind of such rumors, there was a thief who<br>knew he had an opportunity on his hands that was<br>too good to pass up—after all, if a thief were to make<br>good use of such an unusual item, there would be<br>nothing standing between them and their wildest<br>dreams of thievery.<br><br>And so the thief crammed plugs into his ears to make<br>sure he wouldn't be able to hear the instrument,<br>and then snuck into the mansion. Then before long,<br>there he was in the room with the instrument in it.<br><br>And then...<br><br>Wham!<br><br>He takes a wicked blow to the head and passes out<br>instantaneously. You see, since his ears were plugged up<br>nice and tight, he could not hear the mansion's owner<br>sneaking up behind him. And that was in fact his plan<br>all along—the instrument that played itself was<br>a fabrication from the very beginning! And so the<br>greedy thief was bound with rope and stripped<br>of all his earthly possessions.<br><br>――――The princess did not smile.</p>

<p class="para">At the far end of the desert blooms a flower. It's far from<br>water, yet it never withers, and the petals stretching from<br>its stem are beautiful indeed. People wander the desert<br>endlessly for but a glimpse. Do you know why it never wilts?<br><br>Because it enchants its onlookers. The very sight of its beauty<br>inspires wishes that it thrives, and visitors grant it every drop<br>of water they carry. Around it lay the withered husks of bodies<br>that are seldom noticed among the flower's majesty.<br><br>You know, I thought the flower might fetch a high price, so<br>I went to pluck it and grew many more. After all, they're strong<br>enough to live in the desert—cultivation wasn't exactly difficult.<br>I've got so many of them now, but for whatever reason,<br>they don't sell very well.<br><br>―――――――――The princess still won't smile, huh?</p>
