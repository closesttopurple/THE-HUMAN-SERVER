<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">The brigands at the fire voice their displeasure to their leader, a young thief of meager years.<br>The power and influence of the band has grown rapidly,<br>and they came to the ends of the desert to make an even greater name for themselves.<br>The young thief yells at his ragged men.<br>He knows they must be alert at all times if they are to claim the treasures of the White Fortress.<br>But his fellows are overcome with fear at the sight of the castle,<br>so much so that some take the path of the coward and flee.<br>The older men yell. The younger weep.<br>The thief sighs as he watches the scene unfold.<br>A long line of people stand at the entrance to the White Fortress,<br>queued neatly before its impossibly high gates.<br>They are the nouveau riche, come to attend a fine banquet. As they wait,<br>beggars mill about, hoping for the occasional alms or act of charity.<br>The thief weaves his way to the front of the line as though he belongs there.<br>The guard manning the gates stares at him, shocked.<br>"Begging your pardon, sir, but the line begins over—"<br>"I do not appreciate being made to wait," interrupts the thief.<br>His attitude is haughty, his voice filled with unwavering confidence.<br>It is a quality held by only a certain kind of person.<br>It cannot be learned or affected; it is something that must be born into.<br>The boy is clad in resplendent clothing.<br>The jewels decorating his garments glint beneath the torches of the gate.<br>Yet though he wears naught but fakes, his attitude tricks the eye into belief.<br>A moment later, the guard concludes he is different from the nouveau riche,<br>and his gruff expression becomes a cordial smile.<br>"My apologies, sir. Right this way."<br>With barely an effort, the thief has entered the White Fortress through its front gate.<br>His gorgeous clothing flutters behind him as he walks.<br>The plan is for him to enter alone, then throw treasures<br>out the window so his subordinates can gather them up.<br>It is a clever plan. Nearly foolproof.<br>But...<br>As the thief follows his guide through a covered<br>passageway toward the great hall, he looks out beyond the walls.<br>He spots several shadows moving under the cover of darkness: his subordinates.<br>Their backs are turned to the castle, their footsteps leading them into the vast desert beyond.<br><i>They're leaving me</i>, thinks the thief. <i>They are abandoning their leader.</i><br><i>Ah, but I pity them all.</i><br>His subordinates are letting slip the perfect opportunity.<br>Once, long ago, a person called the King of<br>Thieves caused much chaos throughout the continent.<br>Though said to have been the greatest outlaw to ever live, even the<br>King of Thieves had not been able to conquer the White Fortress.<br>Eventually, the King vanished, becoming the stuff of obscure legend.<br>The young thief believes that if he can steal the treasures from this fortress,<br>he will claim the title of King of Thieves for himself.<br>A chance like this will not come again.<br>As the thief enters the great hall, he finds himself surrounded by corpulent men and women.<br>It is not only the nouveau riche in attendance<br>today—royalty from neighboring countries are here as well.<br>All wear their most wonderful clothing and jewels;<br>all work tirelessly to seem superior to their neighbor.<br>The thief knows these foul creatures garbed in finery seek only to enrich themselves.<br>But as he moves from the great hall to the banquet, and then on to the<br>gossipers in the courtyard, they all treat him with dignity and respect.<br>Not a one realizes his true face.<br>The thief steps into the secret underbelly of the castle, leaving the fervor of the feast behind.<br>The corridor is dark. No light penetrates its inky depths.<br>The life he sensed earlier fades as the castle begins to<br>show how it gained the name of Thieves' Graveyard.<br>As he leaps over a pit of spikes, great venomous snakes fall from the ceiling.<br>"It seems the time for cleverness has come," murmurs the thief.<br>As those words escape his lips, the floor begins to fall away,<br>revealing a gaping abyss whose maw threatens to swallow him whole.<br>After avoiding countless tricks and traps, the thief finally reaches the end of the corridor.<br>He finds himself at the pinnacle of the White Fortress: the vault.<br>It is a place unseen by human eyes since its construction.<br>No traps threaten his life anymore; he stands face-to-face with a dusty wooden door.<br>With great care, he pushes the barrier aside.<br>The ceiling is open above him, offering views of all the stars in the sky.<br>And there, in the middle of the treasures from<br>across the continent, rests the thief's ultimate goal.<br>"There you are," he whispers. "At long last."<br>The treasure chest sits pretty beneath a beam of moonlight.<br>The lock glints faintly, as though attempting a final, desperate resistance.<br>It does not take long for the thief to notice the weighty chains encircling the chest.<br>They slither and scrape across the ground, dully reflecting moonlight as they move.<br>For they are attached to something.<br>His gaze follows the chain...<br>He finds it attached to an elderly woman.<br>She rests alone, locked to the chest.<br>Her body is gaunt, her hair a tangled nest. <br>Her tattered clothes are barely worthy of the name.<br>She is mostlike a servant—or a slave.<br>But housed in her eyes is a will too powerful to be contained.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The White Fortress. The Thieves' Graveyard.<br>The young thief has risen to its challenge, and now finds himself facing a slave chained to a chest.<br>Yet he pays this other person no mind, instead drawing his knife.<br>The only sound in the quiet vault is the scrape of metal on metal.<br>He breaks the lock without even the slightest effort.<br>The chest is crammed full of treasures from across the ages.<br>Mirrors made of polished stone. Silver spoons. Staves adorned with animal heads.<br>And thousands of other impossible things.<br>If the thief collected all the items he had stolen in his life,<br>it would not begin to equal the value of the riches before him.<br>He feels as if he might topple into the chest and never emerge.<br>From the end of her chain, the elderly woman watches him intently.<br>This much treasure will permit him to make a glorious name for himself,<br>and assure his subordinates come crawling back.<br>In his excitement, he lifts up the chest and gazes out from the top of the White Fortress.<br>The massive castle stands betwixt desert and sea.<br>One half of the view is ocean; the other, sand.<br>Yet he cannot see his final destination—his own kingdom.<br>Perhaps he can cross the desert alone at night. It is<br>a reckless idea, mad, but it could be his only—<br>"I see an unusual conversation partner has been carried to me on the ocean wind,"<br>comes a woman's voice.<br>"Once a slave. Now a thief. Oh, but I mark you well."<br>The thief whirls around in shock.<br>Not because of <i>who</i>, but <i>why</i>.<br>The bound, elderly woman rests on the floor, a faint smile crossing her face.<br>The thief looks her over anew.<br>Her long hair reaches her chest. Her skin is thin and colorless as papyrus.<br>The heavy chains which bind her have scarred her deeply.<br>He does not recognize her.<br>Yet how can someone he has never met know from whence he comes?<br>No one has ever seen his past before. <i>No one.</i><br>"You press your thumb to the blade when using your knife," chuckles the woman.<br>"You may leave slavehood, but it never leaves you."<br>The thief was not even aware he was doing such a thing.<br>The dull knives given to slaves are not securely attached between blade and handle.<br>As such, they are forced to hold the blade in place with their thumb to prevent its separation.<br>The woman has seen right through him, and he finds himself enraged.<br>"Silence, crone, before I take your tongue!"<br>But the woman only smiles all the wider.<br>"Your accent betrays you as eastern-born. You must have been from a well-off family indeed.<br>Stolen away as a child, perchance?"<br>The thief reels, for she has hit the mark a second time.<br>The woman quickly closes the distance between them, chains rattling behind her.<br>She saw through his secrets at a glance. She guessed his birthplace with a word.<br>She is like a djinn from some cradle tale.<br>One whose form is ever changing so they might confound humans.<br>The woman moves to the thief's side and gently runs a hand over his clothes.<br>"Be not afraid," she says. "What you see is but a trick, and it is not the doings of a djinn."<br>Hearing her read his mind again makes the thief want to cover his ears.<br>She has hit upon his secret: the one he buried years ago and has spent his<br>whole life hiding with a desperation bordering on madness.<br>"Shall I guess why you've come to steal from this place?"<br>Her voice is low and deep; the fact it comes from such an emaciated body is impossibility writ large.<br>The strange aura around the woman drives a thorn of fear into the thief's heart.<br>"Enough," he croaks. "No more."<br>He has his knife at the ready, and could easily dispatch a person so weak and old in years.<br>Yet despite this, he cannot so much as raise his hand, much less remove her tongue.<br>She presses her face close to his.<br>"You come to laugh at the foolishness of the rich."<br>He takes a step back. Stumbles. Nearly falls.<br>"But you have one more motive. The true reason is—"<br><br>"No! Stop!"<br>The thief cannot bear another word.<br>Memories of a past he'd kept hidden for so long were now revealed.<br>They threatened to crawl out from the confinement of his mind and spill across the floor like insects.<br><br>The next thing he knows, he is falling, a cold sweat clinging to his entire body.<br>As the thief crumples to the ground, the woman stands to her full height.<br>"Take me with you. I can help."<br>She lifts arms still bound by chains and urges him to cut her free.<br>The thief looks up.<br>Were he to sever her bonds, what would happen to him?<br>"Your companions have deserted you, and you cannot cross the desert alone."<br>The woman speaks sooth: the nighttime sands are a world of death.<br>One step in the wrong direction dooms a person to<br>wandering a formless labyrinth until the sun claims them.<br>Perhaps this is the reason the White Fortress earned its other name.<br>"Very well," replies the thief at last.<br>Knowing he has no choice, he agrees to cross the desert with the woman.<br>He cuts her free quickly,<br>using skills gained from severing rope countless times as a slave.<br>The woman relishes her freedom, inhaling a lungful of salt and sand.<br>"Now," she says, "Let us begin our journey of salvation."<br>She throws down her lengthy chain from the top<br>of the castle and the two of them use it to abandon the place.<br>Inside the fortress, the party carries on, its guests none<br>the wiser to the miracle which has just occurred.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Footprints leave brief trails in the sand.<br>Having escaped the White Fortress, the young thief and the<br>aged slave move across the midnight wastes.<br>The White Fortress is distant now; no more than a brief spot on the horizon.<br>It is the formerly chain-bound woman who leads him home.<br>She occasionally looks to the sky, checking the direction.<br>They forge onward through the sand, always sure of the way.<br>The gentle night breeze teases her long hair, creating soft waves.<br>Stars glitter in the night sky. Sand glows under the light of the moon.<br>The sight is beautiful—and yet, it is a world that strains life with trial.<br>The thief wraps his clothes tightly around him to keep the cold away,<br>following the woman as closely as he dares.<br>As they walk, she begins to spin her tale.<br>Certain circumstances led to her being imprisoned in the White<br>Fortress, where she had been made to guard the treasure for many a lonesome year.<br>"It was there, at the pinnacle of the castle, that she cultivated her power. <br>The magical skill that allowed her to see through the secrets of others."<br>She chuckles at the deep wounds the chains left on her body,<br>claiming them as prizes rather than scars.<br>As the moon reaches its zenith, they come to a stop.<br>Before them towers a dune high as a mountain.<br>At its peak sits an enormous ship.<br>"A remnant of a bygone era," intones the woman. "One unable to keep pace with the current."<br>Devoid of all its propelling force, the stranded ship sits perfectly still atop the mound.<br>The two travelers approach, gazing up at its massive bulk.<br>Though it has rotted over the ages, the masthead still speaks of its former glory.<br>The thief hates boats, for they bring back memories of<br>his days as a slave—memories he had vowed to never think of again.<br>But it is a small sacrifice in the grander scheme of things,<br>so he signals the woman that they will make camp inside.<br>They enter through the side of the rotting vessel.<br>It is a perfect place to keep away from the cruel bite of the wind.<br>Yet the thief cannot calm the unease in his chest.<br>He rips boards from the side of the ship and sets then<br>aflame, as though attempting to burn his memories away.<br>But after a moment of staring at the fire, he realizes something has changed.<br>The woman is gone—<br>and she is not the only thing missing.<br>The chest he took from the castle has likewise vanished.<br>The young thief hates nothing more in the world than being stolen from.<br>His eyes glint like an animal's as he scans the area. Suddenly, he hears a small laugh.<br>"Shall we continue where we left off in the vault?"<br>The thief looks in the direction of the voice and finds the woman.<br>The chest rests at her side.<br>She looks down at him gleefully from the bow of the stranded ship,<br>then opens the chest and begins rummaging through its contents.<br>"I promised to help you, and help you I shall.<br>Now let us trace our steps back to your sealed memories."<br>She thrusts her arm into the chest and emerges with treasures.<br>Silverware encrusted with tiny jewels. Incense burners with floral patterns.<br>Paintings that fit in the palm of her hand.<br>She pulls forth countless trinkets given as gifts from foreign<br>countries, and the thief finds each and every one of them familiar.<br>"These are all valuable trade items," says the woman.<br>"Ones which have crossed the sea itself to be here.<br>And it is the worthless slaves who carried them."<br>The life of a slave is cheaper than any trinket.<br>And the thief's spirit had been broken after his prolonged treatment as something less than human.<br>"You still have things about your past to tell me, don't you, boy?"<br>The woman sticks her hand into the chest again.<br>Regretting his decision to bring her along, the thief<br>clambers up the ship, hoping to shut her mouth for good.<br>He is one joist away from being able to leap at her.<br>But then the woman produces a ceremonial sword, almost as if she had been waiting for his arrival.<br>The blade is rusted, having long ago been sullied by the blood of another.<br>"Everything was taken from you as a slave, so you found the evil and tore it out by the root."<br>His dignity as a human being? The smile of the one to whom he owed his life?<br>All this and more had been stolen from him.<br>The thief recalls how it felt when he took his<br>master's life—an act done in the hopes of reclaiming what he had lost.<br>"But nothing came back to you," sighs the woman. "And so the slave became a thief."<br><i>So </i> <i>I</i> <i>could be the one doing the taking.</i><br>False clothes cover the truth of who he is.<br>And now, this woman is peeling them back one layer at a time.<br>She stares at the dumbstruck thief in the belly of the ship and produces her next treasure.<br>It is a verdant gem that shines peacefully under the moon.<br>Its delicate glow is almost hidden by the bright glint of its gold edging.<br>"You and this gem are much alike."<br>She smiles at the thief—the false gem who has hidden himself in affectation.<br>"You hate being stolen from, and so steal from others instead.<br>You fear loss,<br>so you hoard all you can.<br>Yet all the stolen treasures in the world will not save you.<br>Instead, they will burden you, bending your back little by little<br>until they finally crush you under their weight."<br>The thief cannot listen to anything else she has to say.<br>She has pulled back the cover on every falsehood that armors him,<br>revealing the truth he so desperately wanted to hide.<br>He adjusts his stance on the beam.<br>As the woman reaches for the final treasure, he grasps the knife at his hip.<br>For he will not permit her to steal any more of his secrets.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The shipwreck was meant to be a place of respite for the night,<br>yet the slave woman is attempting to peer into the thief's past once again.<br>Enraged, he leaps from the beam onto the bow where she awaits.<br>Memories of when he was a slave. A past he tried so hard to suppress.<br>The reason he steals treasure. The reason he collects things of value.<br>She boldly stripped the thief bare of the falsehoods that swaddled him,<br>and is now attempting to drag what lies within into the light.<br>There is only one way to silence her:<br>Taking her life.<br>On the bow, he sees moonlight filtering through golden cloth.<br>The woman is dancing atop the deck, her ragged dress fluttering around her.<br>Seeing this, a sense of nostalgia overcomes him.<br>Deep, deep in his memories, he sees the slave girl—the one<br>who took his hand and smiled at him throughout his days of pain.<br>The woman's expression is achingly reminiscent of the girl's, even though they look nothing alike.<br>The thief can stand no more.<br>"What you take from others are but fakes," says the woman as she writhes.<br>"You use them to create a self that does not exist."<br>She tosses the golden fabric over the side of the ship.<br>"You are just like them—like the rich we so despise.<br>You are a corpse that does nothing but take."<br>"Shut up!"<br>He must kill her. He <i>must.</i><br>Before everything he has built for himself crumbles to ash and blows away.<br>He grips his knife, nicked blade and all, and charges the woman with the force of an arrow.<br>Just as he did when he saved the girl. Just as he did when he took the captain's life.<br>But she sees right through him.<br>She lazily sticks out an arm to ward him off, then extends a foot to trip him off the edge of the deck.<br>He falls with a fearsome scream, rolling over and over down the uncaring<br>face of the dune before slamming into a rock and passing out.<br>The woman gazes down at him with kind eyes.<br>"And now I have stripped you bare, my fellow thief," she murmurs.<br>She leaps gracefully from the deck.<br>The moon has hidden itself away from the approaching sun.<br>As dawn kisses the horizon, a lone woman strides across the desert.<br>She cradles a young thief in her arms.<br>Clad in his falsehoods, the thief sleeps like a baby.<br>She brings him into the ship and gently lays him down.<br>A single ray of light stretches across the ground, signaling the end of that night's world of death.<br>All that remains of the woman are a set of footprints on the sand.<br>The thief feels an unpleasant warmth on his eyelids.<br>As he opens his eyes, the sun's powerful light filters through the rotting wood, washing over him.<br>He is in the belly of the ship.<br>And with that realization comes another:<br>He has been stripped bare of all the finery with which he decorated himself.<br>The knife he used to slay the captain? Gone. His fine clothes? Gone.<br>He has nothing.<br>He lies there in a daze.<br>Beside him, etched into the sand, are these words:<br><i>Remember the day of your birth.</i><br>A bird with a long tail has been drawn next to the phrase.<br>It is the symbol of the King of Thieves—the one renowned throughout the continent.<br>"She got me..."<br>The woman he had freed from the White Fortress—the woman who<br>crossed the desert with him—was the vanished King of Thieves all along.<br>She had become a slave, bound to the vault in the White Fortress.<br>What had she experienced in all that time spent with those who did not consider her human?<br>She had spoken of the rich who stuffed themselves at the banquet.<br>She named them corpses who did nothing but take—and then named him the same.<br>And while the thief hates them, he walks the exact same path.<br>The woman had tried to tell him the right way to live.<br>Though abrasive, her methods befitted the King of Thieves.<br>The thief considers this.<br>He has been stripped of everything.<br>He stares blankly at the sky.<br>How long has it been since he's simply sat and gazed upon a clear blue sky?<br>He feels refreshed—an emotion he thought lost long ago.<br>And strangely, he finds a smile pulling at his lips.<br>A thought suddenly comes to him:<br>"I should get back. I need to steal some clothes for myself."<br>He has no need to hide himself in false treasures.<br>All he needs are clothes that will let him run as he pleases. Clothes that let him survive.<br>With his mind set, the naked thief leaves the ship in higher spirits than he has ever known.</p>
