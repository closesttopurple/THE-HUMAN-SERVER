<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">2020 - Tokyo<br>The ruined city lies covered in a thick layer of cloud.<br>The soft patter of rain echoes through empty streets.<br>Amidst the still and silence, a young voice emerges from the second floor of a crumbling building:<br>"It's okay. A kiss will make the hurt go away."<br>A young girl gently affixes a bandage to a scratch on her little brother's knee.<br><br>The pair have been drifting through the ruined city for days, as though running from something.<br>Wet clothes. Dry throats. Empty stomachs. Lost parents.<br>All these anxieties and fears weigh heavy on their minds.<br><br>Suddenly, there is a quick, faint shudder in the earth.<br>They hold their breaths and grip each other tightly.<br>The ground shudders again.<br><i>It's getting closer.</i><br>They grasp each other's clothes as the shaking grows greater. More intense.<br>The know what is causing it, and that knowledge is a horror.<br><br>But then, the tremors come to a stop.<br>And the bleached white bones of a monster's eyes peer through the building window.<br><br>2028 - Harbor<br>A girl stands on the deck of an escort vessel docked at a military harbor.<br>Clad in a military uniform, she gazes up at the sky.<br>It is the same girl from the abandoned city. She now stands in the warm sunlight, lost in thought.<br>Years have passed since that day; she is no longer a scared little girl, but a soldier.<br><br>"The general is asking for you, Captain," says a boy in the same uniform.<br>She turns around, smoothing hair mussed by the ocean breeze. "I'll be right there," she says softly.<br><br>The girl walks into the ship's control room and finds a number of officers gathered.<br>None are older than twenty; all wear the same worried expression.<br>The general—the same one who has summoned them here—begins his brief in terse tones.<br>"In our previous operation, some of you retreated from the front line without my orders."<br><br>The purpose of the previous operation was to capture Legion.<br>Legion are white monsters with bone-like shells, and the greatest threat humanity has ever known.<br>The organization the girl belongs to was formed for the sole purpose of eradicating Legion.<br>Talented personnel have been gathered from across the world<br>to dispatch the monsters wherever and whenever they crop up.<br><br>Just a few days prior, the girl and her squadron engaged multiple Legion in battle.<br>But faced with greater enemy numbers than anticipated,<br>several of her soldiers lost their nerve and ran.<br>Now those same soldiers sit in the briefing room with sweat running down their bodies.<br>The general opens his mouth to scold them—perhaps<br>even punish them—when the girl suddenly speaks.<br>"I issued the order to retreat, sir" she says.<br><br>Her squad turns to look at her in surprise.<br>She issued no such order. It is a lie. Yet she tells it in order to protect those who serve beneath her.<br>"As the leader of this squad, our failure is my responsibility alone.<br>If there is punishment to be had, permit me to take it in their place."<br>The general stammers in the face of his subordinate's sudden confession.<br>But he quickly regains himself and informs the girl of her punishment:<br><br>Her squad will be assigned to maintenance and cleaning duties about the ship.<br>Said vessel's purpose is to transport some precious cargo overseas.<br>The ship must be fueled and prepped for the journey, then made ready to depart with all speed.<br>Though the girl and her squad are combat personnel,<br>they will now be used as the most base of laborers.<br><br>"I expect this ship to be ready to depart by nightfall," continues the general.<br>"Once preparations are complete, return here."<br>"Should you fail, a number of your squadron will be discharged—no matter where the true fault lies."<br>It is an entirely unreasonable demand, but the girl only nods.<br><br>A moment later, she and her squad gather around a map of the ship on a nearby wall.<br>The girl runs her finger across the map, calling out names as she glides over each room.<br>When everyone has their assignments, she turns to depart.<br>"Begging your pardon, ma'am?" says a young squad member.<br>"But the jobs you gave yourself are...terrible."<br><br>The boiler. The morgue. The sewage tanks.<br>The girl has taken on the most demeaning and horrific tasks for herself.<br>"Oh? I didn't realize," she responds with a smile before dismissing her squad to their work.<br><br>They say no more as they scatter to their stations.<br>The girl makes for the morgue straightaway.<br>Here she finds bodies of those who perished during the voyage,<br>having suffered grave injuries in the last battle with the Legion.<br>She follows the medical team's orders and disposes of the bodies,<br>praying they might find peace in the next life.<br><br>Afterwards, she moves through the ship, taking care of preparation,<br>maintenance, and cleaning in each of her assigned areas.<br>Footsteps echo throughout the ship as her squad rushes to and fro.<br>Crew members offer cheerful greetings as they slip by in cramped hallways.<br>A warm, comfortable breeze blows through the ship as it prepares for an arduous voyage.<br><br>Once she is finished, the girl makes her way to the control room, where the deadline is looming.<br>If she is even one second late, the general will dismiss her squadmates without mercy or recourse.<br>After a moment's hesitation, she pushes open a rigid door to take a shortcut to her destination...<br><br>And finds herself in a storehouse far too large for the ship.<br>In the center lies a sturdy cage that contains the massive Legion they captured the other day.<br>This is the creature to which so many of her squad lost their lives.<br>In an instant, she understands the nature of the ship's "precious cargo."<br><br>She gazes upon its white body, covered by a shell that<br>looks like it might belong to some manner of crustacean.<br>Part of it is stained a deep red, perhaps because it absorbed blood.<br>The left arm is cracked and shattered like porcelain—damage sustained in the recent fight.<br>Images of her squadmates being torn to shreds replay in the girl's mind.<br><br>The Legion's head moves slightly as it turns to look at her.<br>Its eye sockets are empty.<br>But when their gazes lock, a different emotion roils inside of her.<br>She feels as though it sees straight through her, and so looks away.<br><br>Less than two minutes remain until the deadline.<br>The rest of her squad has finished their tasks, and now waits for the girl in the control room.<br>Fifty seconds left. Thirty seconds.<br>None can hide their unease—their entire lives now lie in her hands.<br>With ten seconds to spare, the girl bursts through the door.<br><br>"Sorry to cut it so close!" she says with a grin.<br>Though he seems disappointed, the general announces there will be no further punishment.<br>Muttering his displeasure, he leaves the control room.<br><br>Seconds pass after he leaves.<br>The remaining squad members exchange glances...<br>Before bursting into a raucous cheer.<br>"We knew we could count on you, Captain!" they say.<br>Some laugh. Some shed tears. They crowd around her, reveling in a shared joy.<br><br>The girl has always been willing to place her life on the line for her squad.<br>She is skilled in both martial and intellectual pursuits, as well as capable and kind.<br>She is, in short, the finest leader any of them could ask for.<br>And as the sun dips below the horizon, its few<br>remaining rays shine over them as though giving a blessing.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">2020 - Tokyo<br>Tokyo lies abandoned.<br>A girl and her little brother huddle in a collapsed building, hiding from a monster called Legion.<br>As its earth-shaking footsteps grow closer, the monster's massive face appears in the window.<br>They hold their breath, waiting for it to leave.<br>But no matter how hard they pray, it does not go.<br><br>After a moment of stillness, the monster wails and leans against the building,<br>where it has apparently decided to take its rest.<br>Though the girl's brother is on the verge of tears,<br>she takes his hand and attempts to lead him out quietly.<br><i>I'm the big sister. I need to stay focused.</i><br><i>Because if that thing sees us, it will be over in a moment.</i><br>How much longer would they have to live through this hell?<br><br>2028 - An escort vessel, at sea.<br>After finishing refueling and maintenance at the military harbor,<br>the escort ship sets off across the ocean.<br>The girl gazes at the cloudy sky through the windows of the officer's quarters.<br>"Four hours until we get there," she murmurs quietly. "Guess I've got time to read."<br>The whole squad enjoys a rare bit of downtime as they sail.<br><br>Their mission is the transport of a massive Legion to a foreign research facility.<br>Once there, it will be researched so anti-Legion weapons might be produced.<br>It is a vital mission—one which may well lead to the<br>end of the battle between humanity and the Legion.<br>Once they dock, they will have to transport the creature overland.<br>As it is likely they will encounter more of the Legion;<br>the girl and her squadron are under orders to guard the cargo.<br><br>With their lives, if necessary.<br>The squad is painfully aware of this truth.<br>But for now, they rest to regain their strength.<br>Suddenly, an emergency broadcast echoes through the ship:<br>"Alert. All personnel, report to the control room immediately."<br><br>A minute later, the crew is lined up neatly in the control room.<br>They all wear serious expressions, their relaxed moments from<br>the beginning of the voyage a forgotten dream.<br>The general informs them the ship has received a request for support from their destination.<br>The harbor was attacked by a horde of Legion with no warning,<br>and they are presently engaged in a fierce battle.<br>Their ship has been asked to aid in the fight.<br><br>If possible, they will assemble a vanguard unit and dispatch whatever<br>Legion remain once they make landfall—a most dangerous mission indeed.<br>The general pauses, clearly preparing to ask for volunteers.<br>But the girl takes the initiative and volunteers to lead the charge.<br>The moment she knew someone was being attacked by the Legion,<br>remaining on the ship became untenable.<br><br>She quickly issues orders, assigning her unit various tasks.<br>Some prepare first-aid kits in the infirmary. Others ready a submarine for infiltration.<br>She leads the rest of the squad to the armory.<br><br>They gather black swords, handguns, grenades, and communication devices.<br>Though the squad grumbles about having their rare moment of downtime interrupted,<br>the girl does her best to put their minds at ease.<br>Once they are outfitted, they prepare to leave the armory.<br>But then something shakes the ship. Something <i>massive</i>.<br><br>As an alarm wails to life, a voice crackles over the PA system.<br>"We're under attack! We've got ten Legion on the deck—twenty!<br>There's more! More are coming! Someone get up here and—"<br>There is a crunching sound, followed by a bloodcurdling scream. Then silence.<br><br>The ship is under attack.<br>But why? Why would the Legion be attacking a vessel<br>so far out at sea when the creatures live on land?<br>It is a baffling situation, and panic immediately sweeps over her squad.<br><br>"What's going on!?"<br>"We're nowhere near the harbor yet!"<br>"We need to get on deck NOW!"<br>A window shatters. Metal groans.<br>"Why are they even here!?"<br>"Why is this happening!?"<br>"We're gonna sink! We're all gonna drown!"<br>The girl moves to each soldier in turn, calming them.<br>Once they have themselves under some semblance of control,<br>she whirls around and rushes to the main deck.<br>Though she has survived countless battles with the<br>Legion, this is a scenario she has never before encountered.<br>She prays her unit can somehow remain safe as she<br>flings open the door to the main deck.<br>As she does so, the top half of a human torso comes<br>skittering through the door and down the stairs.<br><br>One of the Legion stands on the deck, its arms<br>covered in fresh blood. It howls, its voice terror incarnate.<br>She has never seen such a creature before.<br>A carapace clings to its back.<br>A hard shell covers countless thin legs and tentacles.<br>Fin-like protrusions wriggle from openings across its body.<br>It is a monster that has adapted to life in the ocean—a kind of crustacean.<br><br>And now it and its fellows are launching a surprise attack at sea.<br>Legion clamber up the side of the ship, shattering windows and wriggling their way inside.<br>Screams ring out. Horror reigns.<br>"No," whispers the girl. "Not here. Not like this. <i>I won't let you</i>."<br>As one of the monsters turns in her direction,<br>she tightens her grip on her sword and prepares to fight.</p>
