<p class="title">Chapter 1: Making Memories (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">"I've separated your meals into portions for each day,<br>so be sure to eat. Okay?"<br><br>We live in a modest apartment. I close the refrigerator<br>door and turn to peer into the living room.<br><br>Then I give laundry and dishes instructions. I go on and<br>on in great detail while my dad just nods quietly—should<br>I be worried about how much of a worrier I am?<br><br>It's just me and my dad here, and I'm busy with high school<br>at the same time. My dad was always so gentle, always<br>wearing a warm smile, but ever since the divorce, he's<br>been practically dead inside.<br><br>One day, his old, cheerful self would return. Or so I told<br>myself as I tackled both school and my part-time job,<br>all while keeping tabs on household expenses and doing<br>housework.<br><br>For a while there, my dad had the most terrible fatigue,<br>but the medicine his doctor recently prescribed has helped<br>him reach a more stable level.<br><br>"Well, I guess I'm off."<br><br>Our school trip starts today. Even though my dad's<br>relatively stable right now, I'm honestly worried sick<br>about leaving the apartment.<br><br>He always sits in the corner of the living room, staring<br>idly at the blank TV. But today, he's come to see me off<br>at the front door.<br><br>"Go on, now. Make lots of memories."<br><br>There's no spirit in the way he carries himself, nor is he<br>smiling, but his kind words remind me of who he used<br>to be. It looks like the medicine is doing its job.<br><br>I packed only the bare necessities in my beat-up duffle bag.<br>It's frayed, but I use it for everything. I cradle it in my<br>arms and leave the house.<br><br>I peek back inside just before I shut the door, as I always<br>do. My dad has already turned away. I can't see his face.<br><br>I look at the time on my phone and realize it's much later<br>than I thought. And here I thought I was going to leave<br>the house with plenty of time to spare...<br><br>I was busy putting everything in place for my dad's<br>convenience while I'm gone on my trip, and I guess<br>I lost track of time.<br><br>I run as fast as I can, but I'm too late. When I get to<br>the bus stop, the bus is already shrinking in the distance.<br><br>My blood runs cold for a second, but it's no time for<br>standing around. If I run to the nearest train station and<br>time my transfers just right, I should make it in time for<br>the meet-up.<br><br>My bag slips. I yank it up. <i>I need to run</i>, I tell<br>myself as I put all my strength into my legs—<br><br>"Pardon me, Miss?"<br><br>A voice from behind me. I whirl around as I pitch forward.<br>There stands an old lady, her face perplexed.<br><br>"Um... Is something the matter?" I say with as calm a voice<br>as I can muster, pushing my disheveled hair behind my ear.<br><br>"There's somewhere I'd like to go, but I seem to be lost..." <br><br>She shows me a note. On it is the name of an orthopedic<br>clinic I recognize.<br><br>"I know where that is."<br><br>The moment I take a step forward, it hits me again:<br>I'm on the verge of being late for my trip.<br><br>Luckily, the clinic is on the way to the station.<br>Once I drop her off, I can probably make the train<br>if I run the rest of the way.<br><br>And so, as to not rush the old lady and her unsteady<br>steps, I walk slowly.<br><br>I drop her off at the clinic with a smile. "I've got to get<br>going." <br><br>She grabs my hand and places a handful of hard candies in<br>my palm. I give her my thanks and run.<br><br>I check the time again—I'm a bit later than I initially<br>wanted. I need to hurry. But then—<br><br>"Stop! Thief!"<br><br>An unusual call from nearby. I stop in my tracks despite<br>myself. <br><br>I see someone dressed as a stereotypical thief—black ski<br>mask and all—rush out from the convenience store with a<br>bag in his arms.<br><br>The man in black must have been hit with security paint<br>because a smear of orange is streaked across his back.<br><br>I calm my shock, gather myself, and then run toward the man. I throw my bag at his feet.<br><br>He trips over it and falls, just as I was hoping for.<br>The convenience store staff run after him and helping<br>passers-by keep him pinned.<br><br>The staff want to shower me in thanks, but I have to hurry<br>to the station. I apologize with a quick bow of my head,<br>collect my bag, and then rush off.<br><br>Of all days, when I'm going on a school trip, why does<br>my life feel like an episode of a TV drama?<br><br>I arrive breathlessly at Tokyo Station to find students<br>wearing the same uniform as me gathered in a group.<br><br>When my friends notice me, they smile and wave me over.<br>I feel awful for making everybody wait as I make my way<br>to the homeroom teacher.<br><br>"It's not like you to be so late. You're usually right on<br>time," he says, but asks nothing more from me and begins<br>to lead all of us students to the bullet train platform.<br><br>I was convinced I was bound to get scolded,<br>so I heave a sigh of relief.<br><br>I sit down in my seat on the train and finally catch my<br>breath. Sitting beside me is a friend I could easily call<br>my best friend.<br><br>We've been in the same class since elementary school—<br>we're inseparable. Every day, she asks me for a favor,<br>"just this once!" and begs me for help with homework,<br>but I just can't bring myself to dislike her.<br><br>"It's honestly been one thing after another today,"<br>I say, my voice a little louder than usual on our first<br>day of the school trip.<br><br>I begin to tell her what happened on the way here, but she<br>gives a disinterested "Mm-hmm" and keeps her eyes on her<br>phone.<br><br>Something feels off about her cold reply. This inseparable<br>friend of mine is the life of our whole class. I recently<br>saw her chatting and laughing happily with everyone about<br>how she was late for the gathering time.<br><br>"Want a candy?" I hold out one of the candies the old lady<br>gave me.<br><br>"No, thanks," she says brusquely. She turns to look out<br>the window as though shutting me out.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Hoping for a Good Trip (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">What a way to kick off a school trip.<br><br>So many things happened before I even managed to make<br>it to the starting point. It seemed for a minute like I was going<br>to be late for my bullet train, but I made it there just in the nick<br>of time and managed to reach my destination.<br><br>The roof that covers the station's central plaza is tall as can be,<br>and is covered by a beautiful mesh of steel and glass. Having not<br>been in the position to go on any kind of trip for a very long time,<br>just knowing that I've made it to Kyoto is enough to light a fire in<br>my heart. After everyone had dealt with their luggage and heard<br>what the teachers have to say we were allowed to enjoy some<br>free time, and in my group is one of my best friends.<br><br>I don't understand why, but something is off about her today.<br>She's as cheerful as ever when talking to others, but when she<br>talks to me she seems kind of...cold, somehow. I wonder if I did<br>something to upset her. As I mull over the situation in my mind,<br>the group decides to take a look around the city.<br><br>The former capital of Kyoto is steeped in history, and not only<br>is the beauty of its architecture is out of this world, but there are<br>adorable decorations made of wood and paper lined up along<br>every store in sight. There are also confectionery stores and<br>places selling tons of chopsticks... We had a great time checking<br>out the various sights the city has to offer.<br><br>And while I'm having the time of my life on this trip, there's<br>a part of me that worries about the father I left behind all alone...<br>He must be waiting for me to come back...<br><br>"It's gonna be great! Don't you think?" I'm pulled back to reality<br>as a friend in my group grabs my arm and talks to me.<br><br>"Oh, uh, sorry... What were we talking about?"<br><br>The place we're headed to next is the spot everyone in the group<br>is most looking forward to visiting. Seeing the excitement on<br>everyone's faces, I remember what's going on and offer a nod.<br><br>Going by the itinerary we planned ahead of time, where we're<br>off to next is a shrine famous as a place that gives good luck<br>to those looking for romantic partners. I must have looked like<br>my mind was elsewhere, because as we make our way to the<br>shrine my friend turns and said, "She's putting on a cool face,<br>but who knows? Maybe she's already got her heart set on someone."<br><br>There's a hint of provocation in her voice. It's like she's taunting<br>me. Everyone else in the group may not have realized it, but I did.<br>Reject her statement as I may, all she does is disregard me with<br>a sly chuckle. <br><br>"Whoa, there's someone you like? Who? WHO!?" I'm questioned<br>by everyone in the group, but I manage to hold my ground by simply<br>smiling and repeating "There's nobody, I swear."<br><br>With a sigh and a desire to move things along, I speak up,<br>"Anyway, let's get moving! I hear you can test what your<br>luck in love will be like!"<br><br>Saying this, I watch everyone in front of me walk along like they're<br>having the time of their lives...and I start to feel a bit blue again.<br><br>It takes everything I have just to make it through the day. Love?<br>When would I have had the chance to think about that?<br>Desperate to act like the normal highschooler I'm supposed<br>to be, I run ahead and join up with the group again.<br><br>At long last, we arrive at the shrine. On the stone path along<br>its premises lie two stones bound with sacred rope. Word has<br>it that if you go to the first stone, close your eyes, and manage<br>to make it to the second stone without looking, you'll find true<br>love. Wasting no time, everyone in the group takes stabs at<br>the challenge, each of them failing with aplomb.<br><br>The two stones are about ten meters apart, and the distance<br>combined with how easy it is to lose your sense of direction<br>once people start calling out to you makes finding your way<br>from one to the other a nearly impossible task.<br><br>Everyone in the group but me has already gone, and not a single<br>one of them has succeeded. I guess it's far more difficult than<br>it looks.<br><br>"You're up," says a friend as they give me a little push on<br>the back. I considering refusing, but decide against it out of fear<br>that everyone would think I'm a wet blanket.<br><br>Resigning myself to my fate, I place my hand on the first stone<br>and my friends begin to excitedly chatter amongst themselves.<br>I close my eyes and, trying to stay on as straight a course as<br>possible, stretch both arms out directly in front of me and move<br>forward one careful step at a time.<br><br>My friends shout directions at me from time to time,<br>but because I'm focused primarily on simply not falling over,<br>I can't really hear what they're saying.<br><br>After what feels like an eternity, I feel my hands press up<br>against cold stone, and my friends erupt in cheers.<br>I open my eyes to see that, somehow, I was the only one<br>in the group who managed to reach the second stone.<br><br>As I'm rejoicing with everyone, we are approached by a group<br>of boys that had been observing from afar.<br><br>"Hey, this looks fun. Maybe I'll give it a try too," says a boy from<br>my class who has always had excellent grades. Our group<br>decides to stick around and see how his shot at the challenge<br>pans out.<br><br>He's the type to knock anything and everything out the park<br>without breaking a sweat, and while it looks for a moment like<br>he might not make it, he manages to reach the second stone<br>on his first try just like I did.<br><br>Returning to his group, his friends engage in some light ribbing<br>to celebrate his achievement. After basking in their cheers,<br>he comes over my way and says, "So it was just us two who<br>got it first try, huh? Maybe we're a good match."<br><br>Unable to determine if there's any sincerity to his words,<br>I simply smile at him and say "Impressive as always."<br><br>The story of what happened at the shrine gets told and retold<br>across the various groups on the trip, and I eventually catch<br>wind of a rumor that says the boy in that group seriously likes<br>me and plans to ask me to go steady at some point during<br>the trip. This news takes me by surprise.<br><br>Thinking on it, I suppose he does send me messages quite<br>often, and there are times we had talked when school was<br>on break, but I never thought he might have feelings for me.<br><br>My friend—the one who had been acting cold lately—turns to<br>me and says, "Yeah, I figured you'd react like that." I detect a<br>tone of malice in her voice. "You just gonna pretend you had<br>no clue lots of guys are into you?"<br><br>She knows that I have trouble with these kinds of topics,<br>and she's usually the one to help me find ways to navigate<br>them whenever they come up. Why is she doing this?<br>What's up with her today?<br><br>"No, uh...I just... I had no idea..." As I put on a fake smile<br>and desperately await the arrival of a different topic of<br>conversation, I let out a small sigh that I hope nobody hears.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: A Lot Happened (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">After leaving my father at home all alone, I've come to<br>Kyoto on a school trip. Dad told me to come out here and<br>make lots of memories, but I simply can't find a way to get<br>my spirits out of the gutter.<br><br>There's been a strange, prickly vibe whenever I'm around<br>the friend who's been cold to me lately. What's more, there<br>are silly rumors going around that one of the boys on the<br>trip is planning to ask me to go steady with him.<br>That topic is obviously one I'm not interested in entertaining<br>any sort of discussion on, so I do my best to just act normal.<br><br>After everyone had finished eating dinner at the inn we're all<br>staying at, it's time for us all to get back into their groups and<br>take their turns hitting the baths. Our trip's just about over,<br>and we're set to head home tomorrow.<br><br>As I take another look at a copy of our schedule, I notice my<br>cell phone vibrating. I guess someone's sent me a message.<br><br>"Can you come to the roof of the inn?"<br><br>The above message displays alongside the name of a boy<br>in my class. I start to break out in a cold sweat. My head limply<br>hanging, I stare down at my cell phone's screen and consider<br>my options. I could just pretend I never saw the message...<br>But...<br><br>"I'll be right there."<br><br>After sending off my reply, I throw a coat on over my robe and<br>get on the elevator to the roof. The inn we're staying at is on the<br>outskirts of the city, and the roof offers a beautiful view of Kyoto.<br>The nightscape of the ancient capital boasts an elegance unlike<br>anything you'd see in in the harshly lit metropolis of Tokyo.<br><br>"Nice view, huh?" I call out to the boy waiting on the roof.<br>He should have heard the sound of the door opening and<br>realized I'd come, but his back remains turned. Arriving by his<br>side, I suddenly feel an incredible awkwardness. I simply stare<br>at the sleeves of his robe dancing in the wind as I wait for him<br>to say something.<br><br>"Thanks for coming," he says.<br><br>"Don't mention it," I reply, sensing a kind of unsteadiness<br>in his voice. The conversation stops, and I gaze upon the<br>view for a short while.<br><br>"So, uh..." The boy speaks up again. "I kind of, uh...really like<br>you. I always have," he admits.<br><br>"Oh..." I reply, noticing that he's now turned to face me.<br>There is a sense in determination in his posture, but I notice<br>he's avoiding eye contact. Maybe he's nervous? Hoping it'll<br>get him to continue, I offer a small nod in response.<br><br>Summoning his courage, he finally exclaims,<br>"So, what I want to say is...please be my girlfriend!"<br><br>"......"<br><br>I fall silent for a short while, feeling the boy's timid gaze on<br>me as he awaits my reply. I'm sure I must have quite the<br>troubled look on my face. It's not as though I don't like him.<br>In fact, I think he's a great classmate, but...that's all he is<br>to me, really.<br><br>"I'm...not the kind of person you think I am..." A strange<br>look crosses the boy's face as he listens to me talk.<br>"There's got to be someone out there who's a better<br>match for you. I just...don't think I'd be good enough for<br>you." Ending my explanation, I leave the roof as quickly<br>as my feet can manage, not stopping to listen to what he<br>tried to say in response.<br><br>Wondering to myself if I did a good job handling that<br>situation, I return to the elevator hall to see a familiar<br>highschool girl sitting on a nearby sofa. It's my best<br>friend...the one who's been cold to me throughout the<br>entire school trip. Unsure of why she's there, I glance<br>in her direction and she makes a sour face in response.<br><br>"You know that I like him, don't you? I swear, you are<br>just the worst." She pouts.<br><br>In that moment, I finally understand what it is that's been<br>on my friend's mind this entire trip—that boy is the reason<br>she's been acting so weird this whole time. She knew that<br>he was planning to ask me to be his girlfriend at some point<br>during this trip and couldn't keep her emotions in check.<br><br>Hoping to finally nip this situation in the bud, I talk to her<br>about how I feel—nothing but the truth. I tell her that I did not<br>know she has feelings for the boy...and that I turned him<br>down after he confessed his feelings to me. As I finish,<br>she looks at me with surprise in her eyes. "Seriously?<br>I thought for sure you'd start dating. You seem like you'd<br>be perfect for each other..."<br><br>After a moment passes, she casts her gaze at her own<br>feet and continues, "I mean, compared to you, I...<br>I'm not nearly as pretty...or as smart...I could never work<br>up the nerve to tell him how I feel... I mean, he'd obviously<br>turn me down flat..." I can hear the pain her voice as she<br>talks. I had no idea she had this side to her. She's so cheerful<br>all the time, and always at the center of whatever group she's<br>in. I'm briefly surprised by this unknown side of her, but that<br>surprise is quickly overwritten with shame. After all, I know<br>better than anyone that we all have sides of ourselves we<br>never show to others...<br><br>My depressed friend and I return to the room where our group<br>is staying, an upon opening the door, something suddenly comes<br>flying in our direction. I dodge, and it hits my friend in the face.<br>It's a pillow. "All right, who threw this!?" yells my friend,<br>immediately returning to her usual high-octane self as she<br>jumps into the fray of pillow-throwing girls.<br><br>"Now that everyone's here, let's add a new rule into the mix!"<br>shouts one of the girls that was already part of the melee.<br>"Whenever you throw a pillow at someone, you've got to tell<br>them something you wouldn't usually say to their face!"<br>My friend, who you wouldn't think was sad as can be just<br>moments before, quickly rises to the challenge.<br>"That's a dumb rule. I'm SO in," she sneers as she grabs<br>a pillow and bravely marches into battle.<br><br>I move to the corner of the room, and just as I'm taking<br>off my coat and placing it on a hanger... Wham! A pillow<br>violently collides with my back, and I hear my someone<br>yell, "You know, you really are way too much of a wet<br>blanket in situations like these!<br><br>I turn to the voice and see my good friend staring at me<br>with a complicated look on her face. Slightly troubled,<br>I pick up the pillow. As I do, I hear other girls in the room<br>say things like "You know what? She might have a point,"<br>and "C'mon! Say something back!" as they try to goad<br>me into joining the action.<br><br>Reluctantly, I throw the pillow back at her and say,<br>"Would it kill you to do your homework for once?"<br>opting to point out a relatively mundane flaw of hers.<br><br>In short order, she then throws the pillow back at my<br>face with even greater force than before. "Everyone<br>knows that you think you're better than everyone else<br>just because you're an honors student!" she exclaims.<br><br>"What's that supposed to mean?" I reply, a bit taken aback.<br>Looking around, I notice that all the other girls are busy with<br>their own pillow fights. Nobody is paying attention to us anymore,<br>but I can tell that my friend is being serious right now.<br><br>Bothered by her provocative words, I start to lose control of<br>the emotions I had been keeping bottled up.<br>"You rely too much on others! Why can't you put even the<br>slightest bit of effort into anything you do!?"<br>This exclamation is how I honestly feel.<br><br>Whether it's for homework or studying before tests, she<br>always tries to take the easy road by leaning on me for<br>solutions. After throwing the pillow, I'm surprised at myself<br>for having said that... And just like that, the floodgates<br>open, and my friend and I engage in a heated pillow fight,<br>with each pillow thrown flying on wings of brutal truth.<br><br>"You always look down on me! You think I'm just an airheaded<br>dope who always goes with the flow, don't you!?"<br><br>"Oh my god, what is WITH your persecution complex?<br>Maybe it'd help your emotional stability a bit if you actually<br>accomplished something on your own for once!"<br><br>"You know everyone just uses you, right!? I bet you feel<br>so smug all the time, thinking everyone's always hanging<br>around you because they like you as a person!"<br><br>"Oh, shut up! I'm not gonna take that from someone who<br>can't even finish their homework unless they have someone<br>holding their hand the entire time!"<br><br>"The way you act like you can do anything is SO annoying!<br>What on earth do guys see in you!?"<br><br>"What are you even talking about!? Honestly, the way you<br>make these random assumptions and then act out based<br>on them is unbelievably aggravating!"<br><br>"Random assumptions!? You're one to talk! God, it must<br>be nice to be you—you've got everything!"<br><br>"I... I have nothing! Do you have any idea how much work<br>I had to put in to make it this far!? How much I had to suffer!?<br>You've got guts pretending to be my friend when you don't<br>even know the first thing about me!"<br><br>Locked in our intense pillow fight of truths, we didn't realize<br>that all the other girls were completely overwhelmed by our<br>battle and had stopped to watch. "Uh... Those two might<br>be taking this too seriously," says one, clearly aghast.<br><br>Ignoring the confused voices that surround us, my friend and<br>I continued our great pillow war until one of our teachers came<br>to the room and gave us a thorough scolding for the incredible<br>amount of noise we were making.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Memories Made (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Our school trip comes to an end, and we ride the bullet<br>train home. I sit next to my old friend, just as I did<br>on the way there.<br><br>Just the previous night, we bashed each other both with our<br>pillows and our honest feelings.<br><br>Despite how much I want to put responsibility on the boy<br>she's crushing on—who told me how much he likes <i>me</i>—<br>I know that was simply the spark that started the fire.<br><br>In the end, I realize we've been bottling up a lot of<br>things. Yelling at each other was awfully cathartic, but<br>it's entirely possible that was only temporary as well.<br><br>Even after the Kyoto scenery vanishes from the train window,<br>the silence continues.<br><br>Talk about awkward...<br><br>As I sit in silence, making no effort for conversation,<br>she sticks her hand out to me. "Want some candy?"<br><br>It's a pretty piece of hard candy with traditional colors<br>that she bought as a souvenir.<br><br>"...Sure. Thanks." I accept it with a genuine smile,<br>and she returns a look of relief.<br><br>I suppose she felt the same way I did. Even if the words<br>she slammed me with last night during our pillow fight were<br>real, she was still the same as ever—my best friend, even<br>after all this time.<br><br>As I enjoy the sensation of the candy rolling around in my<br>mouth, she suddenly speaks.<br><br>"...Do you remember the first time I had my heart broken?"<br><br>I remember it as clear as day.<br><br>"That was in fourth grade, right? We sat in the park,<br>and I listened to you complain all day."<br> <br>"Yeah... I was always grateful for that."<br><br>That was so long ago. We've been in almost every class<br>together since elementary school, and my memories of each<br>school year are filled with her smiles.<br><br>"Listen... I've been kind of lonely lately," she says.<br><br>My eyes widen.<br><br>She then goes on to tell me what she's been keeping close<br>to her chest.<br><br>Ever since we started high school, she feels like I've been<br>distant. She's worried I've been forcing my smiles, unlike<br>the times in the park when we'd sit and complain with one<br>another.<br><br>She's ever cheerful and the life of the party, yet the<br>loneliness on her face has never been more evident.<br>I place my hand on hers, and I reflect on my answer.<br><br>"...I'm so sorry I didn't notice. I've been so focused on<br>what's going on at home, and I..."<br><br>"Right! If you just told me what's going on, I'm sure I<br>could help you!"<br><br>I can't tell her. <br><br>But I am genuinely delighted to hear those words. I've been<br>blessed with such a good friend, but here I am, neglecting<br>her...<br><br>Afterward, we talk and laugh about the events of the trip<br>and reminisce on old memories as though making up for the<br>entirety of our awkward school trip.<br><br>And then, eventually, we tire ourselves out from talking<br>and fall asleep...<br><br>After we get to Tokyo and say goodbye, I receive a message<br>in my school group chat.<br><br>It's a picture of me and my old friend, heads leaning<br>against each other as we slept.<br><br>The warm, golden glow of sunset washes over us. Saliva<br>spills from the corner of my friend's mouth, reminding me of<br>how she was in elementary school. I can't help but smile.<br><br>"I'm so glad we made up." <br><br>I couldn't buy any souvenirs like the rest of my classmates,<br>but I made more than enough memories to share with my dad.<br>As the ideas bounce around in my mind, I step back inside<br>the apartment.<br> <br>There, I find the small room dim, moonlight peeking through<br>the drawn curtains. Dad must already be asleep.<br><br>I take a few steps inside, and a slightly stale, sweet scent<br>greets me. I then notice several beer bottles scattered<br>across the floor.<br><br>"Dad?" <br><br>He remains huddled under his blanket and does not turn to<br>look at me. His medicine sits untouched on the table.<br><br>I notice parts of the room have been riddled with traces of<br>my dad's pain—I can only imagine the state he's been in<br>while I was away.<br><br>I can't believe I left him alone like this... A bottomless<br>well of guilt fills my chest.<br><br>I rode the train with my friends, and we went sightseeing<br>together. In a place with a beautiful nighttime view, a boy<br>from my class told me he liked me. I fought with my<br>best friend, and then we made up...<br><br>It was like the entirety of high school life was condensed<br>into the span of a few days.<br><br>Those brilliant memories begin to blur and fade like a<br>fantastical dream. And yet, I find an odd sense of relief,<br>like they've returned to where they belong.<br><br>My phone suddenly buzzes—I have a message from my boss at<br>work, which pushes down the warm chats I was having with<br>friends.<br><br>It's about something I could <i>never</i> tell another soul.<br><br>I go stiff as I stare at the screen when yet another message<br>comes through. It's from my oldest and best friend.<br><br><i>You can talk to me about whatever you need to from now<br>on, okay? I can't promise I'll ever be much help, but I'm<br>always on your side.</i><br><br>She must have been embarrassed by the unusually honest<br>message because she follows it up with a silly emoji.<br><br>That's so like her.<br><br>But I'm sorry, I...<br><br>It takes me a few minutes to think of a response.<br><i>If anything happens, you'll be the first to know!</i><br>I send her the message, then switch to my chat with my boss. <br><br><i>Thank you for letting me take a few days off.<br>I'll be back at it tomorrow.</i><br><br>This is all for my dad, after all.<br><br>The moon slinks behind the clouds, and darkness engulfs the<br>room. I shut off my phone and sit beside my snoring dad.<br><br>I made so many memories, Dad.<br><br>These are my first and last memories of a normal high school<br>life. I always figured I would graduate without ever getting<br>the opportunity, so what I have is enough. It's perfectly<br>sufficient.<br><br>"...I'm home..."<br><br>I announce with a quiet, dry whisper and a smile.</p>

<p class="para">Papa: Hina looked like the perfect student in all those<br>memories we had on our little journey. But the girl walking<br>around with me felt completely unlike her. She was still<br>kind, though. Like when she saved little ol' me from getting<br>pecked to death by those black birds! But when she'd get<br>scared of heights or lightning or stare out hopelessly at<br>the scenery, she did strike me as a normal girl. Maybe<br>she's her true self when she's in The Cage...<br><br>Hina: What are you muttering into your phone?<br><br>Papa: Oh, I thought I'd start keeping a little journal.<br>You've been recording what's happening on our journey<br>on your phone too, right?<br><br>Hina: Sure, but... Wait. How do you know about my diary?<br><br>Papa: I had a little peek... Er, Hina? I've heard of<br>staring daggers, but this is more like chainsaws!</p>

As they stood in line for a ride<br>in the harsh sunlight, their father grew faint and dizzy.<br><br>"Dad, are you okay?"

Get away!" She felt a slight pang of regret<br>when she saw how he hung his head, but she was more<br>concerned with caring for her dad.
