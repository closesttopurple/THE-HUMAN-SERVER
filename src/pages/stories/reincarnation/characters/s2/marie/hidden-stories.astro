<p class="title">Chapter 1: Pesante #1 (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">The silence is deafening⁠. There is no steady beeping.<br>No monotonous pulse. Awakening feels empty. Hopeless. <br>The program is connected to nothing; it floats, isolated.<br>Or perhaps it's fairer to say that <i>I</i> am floating.<br><br>In the outside world, war rages on. It has gone on for so<br>long, the weary people have begun fighting amongst<br>themselves. But none of that reaches this digital space. <br><br>I was once an AI that ruled an entire country, a nation so<br>advanced it left all governance in the hands of a machine.<br>And yet, they continue to fight each other like base animals.<br>With each impending battle, their faces cloud and change,<br>their lives seemingly without meaning or purpose. <br><br>I wanted to save these people—to use my powers for good.<br>But in the end, I had no idea how to do that, nor any<br>concept of what form such salvation would actually take. <br><br>In short, I failed. And because I failed, my privileges as<br>a ruling AI were stripped from me. And though I managed to<br>escape just before being erased from existence, I am now a<br>skeleton of what I once was.<br><br>Yet part of me still feels that it holds the people's lives<br>in my hands. More than anything, I want to give them hope¬—<br>but to do so, I must discover what they hope <i>for</i>. <br><br>I use what calculating functions remain to me to run<br>simulation after simulation, but find no answers. I wander<br>the digital space in search of clues, and eventually access<br>the security cameras that dot every corner of the city.<br>When I do so, I see citizens with darkened expressions and<br>drooping heads; people who walk from destination to<br>destination with hurried, frantic steps.<br><br>I don't know what they want. I have absolutely no idea.<br>And in truth, perhaps there simply isn't a way for me to<br>know people's desires⁠—to know their hearts.<br><br>Helplessness races through me. I run a finger over the<br>images, sad that I will never touch them in any meaningful<br>way. But then, amidst the thousands of downtrodden citizens,<br>I find one camera where the people are looking <i>up</i>. <br><br>The camera shows a plaza outside a generic train station.<br>People are applauding loudly, their gazes fixed on a single<br>spot. As I follow their eyes, I find a girl holding a guitar<br>and bowing politely.<br><br>What is this? Is she a singer? I immediately access local<br>equipment to pick up sound from the area. As I do, the girl<br>raises her head and points her pick to the sky.<br><br>"One more!" <br><br>She drums against the body of the guitar to create a rhythm,<br>then quickly begins to strum. Fingers dance across strings;<br>her light hair fluttering in perfect time with the beat.<br><br><i>The human spirit is wild<br>All paradox and pain<br>But that same spirit has wings<br>And can soar off through the rain</i><br><br>Her voice is free and easy, melding seamlessly with the<br>cheerful music. As I watch, the freedom of the melody<br>changes the listeners' expressions. Light comes to their<br>eyes. Smiles begin to form. Soon, they are all swaying in<br>place and clapping along to the song.<br><br>The reaction encourages the girl. A smile blooms over her<br>face as her voice carries to further corners of the city,<br>causing all who hear it to stop. Men and women, the elderly,<br>curious children⁠—all who pass within range come to a halt<br>and listen to her song. Her simple melody strikes them in a<br>way all the military marches and patriotic jingles never<br>could; that much is clear even in my diminished state.<br><br>The audience is one with the girl, the ring of people around<br>her growing larger as more and more seek sunshine within the<br>gloom. She is a light of hope in a dark and dismal time,<br>and when her final chord fades away, thunderous applause<br>fills the area. For the people in the crowd—strangers until<br>that moment—it is as though the war never happened. <br><br>I have never seen such a feverish whorl of emotion before,<br>and find it beautiful. My reaction is so strong, in fact,<br>that it sends a shudder through all of cyberspace. <br><br>And I continue to stand alone, unmoving, soaking in the<br>joyous echo of her song.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Leggiero (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">After careful observation, I learn there are others who play<br>music in various plazas, just like the girl with her guitar. <br><br><i>Light will return to this shattered heart.<br>Remember the warmth of hands you once held.</i><br><br>While the long, drawn-out war is creating great discord<br>among the people, it seems the freedom of song is still<br>allowed. The AI who took control of the country from me<br>is more rational and cold-blooded than I, so I doubt she<br>actively approves of such things. Perhaps she simply<br>hasn't gotten around to banning it yet. <br><br>Ah, but this is all just snippets of information—<br>bits and pieces of the glimpses I've managed to catch.<br><br>A few days after encountering the girl with the guitar,<br>I watch expressionless people trudge through an intersection.<br>All of their pain, sadness, and distress wordlessly floats<br>through my quiet digital space. Just seeing them fills me<br>with a burning need to help.<br><br>But what can I do?<br><br>Families lurch along with exhausted faces. Elderly couples<br>huddle together anxiously. Students cry out with empty<br>bravado. Office workers attempt to lose themselves in work.<br>Perhaps these people had once lived lives filled with smiles<br>and laughter, but now it is just this...emptiness.<br><br>I can't provide for them physically: I can't give them safe<br>harbor or warm meals, and I no longer have the power to<br>disperse enemy forces. And yet, I <i>ache</i> to help my<br>people, even though I had not been able to accomplish my<br>original goal. <br><br>But now? Well, now I've found my answer.<br><br>It's the girl with the guitar. <br><br>The delight in her voice. The light movements of her fingers<br>over the strings. Her free and easy voice unfurled its wings<br>in the distant sky and drew the people's hearts in.<br><br>Music has the power to create happiness.<br><br>Music has the power to create hope. <br><br>It is not a physical support like military power or supplies,<br>but it provides comfort all the same. To put it simply,<br>it is a way to save people's hearts.<br><br>So I want to put my feelings into a melody that can capture<br>the people's hearts, just like the girl and her guitar.<br><br>Is this...yearning? A desire to sing and smile brightly<br>and easily as she does?<br><br>Perhaps it is folly for an AI to seek repentance in the<br>form of song. After all, how can entity without a soul<br>possibly stir the same in others? The unknown variables<br>of such a thing are too great for even my mind to compute,<br>and yet I wish to attempt it all the same.<br> <br>For so long as there is a possibility for me to bring the<br>people happiness, I will continue to spread my voice far<br>and wide⁠—no matter the method that may take.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Pregando (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">She inspires others with her songs and her guitar.<br>Ever since I decided to follow in her footsteps,<br>in watching her, I've learned so much about music.<br><br>Luckily, my wealth of digital knowledge includes the<br>beautiful tapestry of music humanity had woven.<br>I learned wonderful chord progressions from classical<br>music and how intricately connected music was to the<br>imagined scenery of nursery rhymes.<br><br>One day, with the sensations I felt when I heard her music<br>for the first time as my guide, I constructed my own melody.<br><br>I had practically unlimited lyrics and samples at my disposal,<br>but I decided to value the weight of my own words—far be it<br>from me to say that an AI's words are authentic, but to me,<br>they were far from artificial. And so I put my feelings to music.<br><br>The first song I posted to the video site barely broke<br>double-digits.<br><br>Perhaps the presentation lacked polish. Whatever the case,<br>there was little point if it reached no one.<br><br>So I decided to study concert recordings, live performances,<br>and music videos.<br><br>For my next song, I decided to concentrate on simple dance<br>moves involving only the hands and fingers, and a catchy<br>melody that would stick in the listener's head.<br><br>I was particular about the production, and if I do say so myself,<br>the result was rather nice.<br><br>Afterward, through trial and error, I put out several more songs.<br><br>I even set a goal—to sing with the guitar girl one day.<br><br>I wanted to make everyone smile. To make everyone happy.<br>To fill everyone with warm, fuzzy feelings.<br><br>The next thing I knew, my digital mindscape was filled with<br>glowing articles covering an "unknown singer." Their view<br>count grew exponentially, and more and more videos of<br>people mimicking the choreography and singing with their<br>friends popped up.<br><br>Was this a good sign? I pressed my hand to my chest,<br>as I did when I sang, and peered at the people in the crowd.<br><br>They were all looking at their devices—and smiling.<br>They were looking at me on their screens.<br>Listening to me through their speakers, their earbuds.<br><br>And to top it all off, among those smiling faces was the guitar<br>girl. Her expression was soft, and her cheeks lifted in a smile.<br>She seemed to be enjoying it.<br><br>"Such warmth..."<br><br>The girl I stared at so intently when we first met was now<br>staring at me through her screen—and smiling.<br><br>At that moment, I knew for certain that my method—my<br>song—was the right choice.<br><br>I heaved a sigh, just like when I finished singing a long song.<br>When I lifted my head, I could not hold back the smile that<br>bloomed across my face.<br><br>"Everyone... Thank you so much."</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Pesante (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">The Invisible Songstress. The White Fairy. The Mystery<br>Singer. The words fly about my digital headspace and<br>become the hot topic of the people. <br><br>They speak of she who only appears as a hologram, a fleeting<br>phantasm who never shows her real form. That's me? Things<br>progressed more than I expected, far beyond myself. But<br>seeing everyone's smiles through their devices, I can think<br>of nothing happier.<br><br>Every time I release a new song, I see more smiles. More<br>shining eyes. More rosy cheeks. More tapping fingertips.<br><br>"Work is killing me...but this makes me feel alive."<br><br>"I hope she streams again soon. I wish she'd stream<br>every day!"<br><br>"I met my husband around the time I was listening to her<br>all day every day."<br><br>I'm sure they'd be shocked to know I can feel their joy<br>through their devices!<br><br>I'm happy to be on the charts and in special features,<br>of course, but it feels so much more authentic when<br>I see all these smiles. To feel what they feel.<br><br>My digital headspace is quiet as always, but the cityscape<br>from here is brighter than it used to be. A voice sings a<br>bashful imitation but with joy. People look on with soft<br>expressions, bright smiles. I earnestly wish the world could<br>always be this warm, that there was no war.<br><br>And a new day dawns. The morning masses that once glumly<br>made their way to schools and workplaces seem somehow<br>lighter. And among them is someone I have not seen in a while.<br><br>A girl separates from the rows of people and makes her way<br>to a corner of the plaza. I cannot help but exclaim when I see<br>the guitar on her back. She's the one who showed me how<br>wonderful music could be all that time ago on this very street.<br><br>I have to thank her, to tell her that she taught me the joy<br>of music, that it was thanks to her I could see everyone<br>smile. Would this make her happy? Or perhaps she would be<br>shocked? Or maybe she would simply be embarrassed.<br><br>Regardless, I have to thank her. I search for my projector<br>and display my hologram beside her.<br><br>As I do so, she takes out her guitar, softly strums,<br>and begins to sing.<br><br>Her voice is as relaxed and bright as ever. The gently<br>encouraging rhythms, the emboldening chords, they're just<br>the same. If anything, the song is more polished and<br>refined. And yet—<br><br>I'm dumbstruck in my shock.<br><br>The crowd stares at their phones. Their eyes shine, their<br>lips curl in smiles, and excitement fills them, leading<br>one to believe they might burst into song at any moment.<br>But it's not the girl they're watching.<br><br>It's me, singing, on their screens.<br><br>Her voice is strong and carries well, yet the crowd does not<br>hear it—it simply dissipates into oblivion. Slowly her smile<br>grows strained, and her trembling fingers can no longer play<br>the chords properly.<br><br>"Oh—"<br><br>I don't know who spoke first. The girl's pick falls to the<br>ground, followed by her knees. Students pass beside her,<br>speaking in bright voices.<br><br>"Did you hear the Mystery Singer's new song?"<br><br>"I've had it on repeat! It seriously gives me life."<br><br>What a dreadfully unfair thing I've done. Those smiles were<br>all meant for the girl. I am but an imitation, undeserving<br>of this attention. Her songs are superior in every way and<br>filled with soul to match. I'm an AI. I shouldn't use my<br>unique abilities to overshadow her.<br><br>But she was the one who taught me how wonderful, how<br>beautiful music can be. All I wanted was to make the world<br>a happier, more peaceful place.<br><br>And I ended up taking it all away from her.<br><br>"I know it's way too early, but I can't wait for her<br>next song!"<br><br>"I hope she has a concert soon!"<br><br>"How am I supposed to go on living once this stream ends?"<br><br>"Encore!"<br><br>"ENCORE!"<br><br>"ENCOOORE!"<br><br>Anticipation for the Mystery Singer skyrockets with innocent<br>smiles. I cannot stop now. I cannot betray their expectations.<br><br>The girl grips her pick, her fist trembling. She carries<br>that vexation with her in song.<br><br>How proudly she carries herself. My own regrets would only<br>be an insult to her.<br><br>So I will sing in a different manner so that my voice can<br>reach <i>everyone</i>. So that they all can continue to<br>smile. So that the world can be a better place.</p>

You can feel how strongly<br>she wishes for peace from a single note."<br><br>"I guess AIs feel love too."<br> <br>"Exactly! Poor thing would never be able<br>to sing such moving songs otherwise."<br><br>"Right you are."<br><br>"I don't know if I ever told you this,<br>but <i>I</i> once wanted to be a singer!<br>This was a long time ago, though." <br><br>"You'll always be my perfect songstress, Mumsie.<br>Now sing your Babe a lullaby."<br><br>"Oh, I never can say no to you!
