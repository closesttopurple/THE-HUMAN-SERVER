<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">Leaders who commit errors and tools that no longer serve their purpose both face the same end—a fact<br>even more inevitable for those who hold both functions. The girl knows this. She knows it very well. The<br>high-rise building where she currently stands offers a fine view of other skyscrapers and the warplanes<br>that patrol the airspace without pause. It is almost as if the capital holds equal pride in both.<br><br>Colorful advertisements shower the buildings inside and out in unending neon rain. <br>One of them washes over the girl as she stares out the massive window of a conference room. <br>Her lips move, weaving the words of a sage. <br>"I want to go over our strategy for rescuing our POWs." Platinum hair. Pale skin. Her<br>voice and physique are that of a young maiden.<br><br>Had she been in any other position, people would have fallen over themselves to celebrate her perfect<br>appearance. Yet upon closer inspection, it is almost <i>too</i> perfect. Her stunning emerald eyes,<br>for example, are a hue that does not exist in the natural world. The reason for this is simple: She is an<br>object crafted by humans. She is not one of god's creations with a body of flesh and blood. Instead,<br>she is the heart of the country's intellect, the apex of their scientific prowess. She is an artificial<br>intelligence burdened with the authority to rule. A thinking machine that determines the destiny of all<br>mankind. It is an almost overwhelming responsibility.<br><br>Currently, the AI is projecting a semi-transparent image of herself into the conference room. Because<br>she needs no rest, she works at the business of governing tirelessly and without pause. <br>Her presence is so pervasive, she has come to be seen as <br>a kind of divine figure by the majority of the population.<br><i>Although that's going to change once the second unit comes online...</i><br><br>Shaking her head to clear this thought away, she turns to face the meeting attendees once more.<br>Small tables have been arranged like pews in a church so all present might admire their ethereal<br>creation. Each table contains a handful of elderly individuals. <br>These people are collectively known as the Conclave. <br>It is their duty to ensure the needs of humanity are met under the AI's governance. Each time<br>the girl nears a decision, they offer suggestions and tweaks from a human point of view. <br>Yet despite the monumental importance of this task, their faces appear relaxed and worry-free. <br>"She will deal with everything," they often say. "After all, she cannot fail." <br>Having created their new god, they now worship it with a fervor bordering on madness. <br><i>How in the world did we get to this point?</i><br><br>When the AI returns to the topic of the POWs, <br>the Conclave members stare at her with clear and happy expressions. <br>She alone understands the severity of the situation. <br>She alone recognizes the horrors of war.<br>Despite how the elderly humans barely pay any mind, <br>she speaks with passion—but it is more than mere kindness and duty that drives her this day.<br><br><i>Six hours earlier...</i><br><br>The girl stands alone before a solitary jail cell. Inside, a hoarse voice produces a few bars of song. <br>When the singing comes to an end, she asks a question to the unseen vocalist: <br>"Do you like music?" A bashful voice replies in turn. <br>"No, not me. But my daughter..." There is a weak laugh that causes the girl to cast her<br>eyes downward. <i>I should have known.</i> <br>The daughter he mentions is currently imprisoned by their enemy in an ongoing war. <br><i>Of course he's thinking of her; they're both currently rotting away in prison.</i><br><br>The man was once a member of the Conclave. <br>But certain actions had caused him to lose both his position and his freedom. <br>The enemy knew he was a high-ranking member of the government, making his daughter a<br>very valuable prisoner. And she quickly became fodder for further negotiation—as well as treason. <br>The enemy had threatened unspeakable things to his child, <br>and after many sleepless nights, he finally handed over classified information in <br>exchange for her safety. But the government cared not for his reasons; they cared only<br>that he had committed the crime. His punishment had been both swift and harsh.<br><br>"Thank you," calls the man from behind the door of his cell. "I mean it. Thank you."<br><br>In any other situation, the man would have already been set to dance on the gallows. <br>But the girl had intervened. His crime was grave. <br>She understood this. And yet, he was also a kind of victim, and she knew that taking his<br>life would not rectify the wrong which had been done. So the girl allowed the man to determine his<br>own fate: Death...or life in prison.<br><br>In many ways, it was the cruelest of choices. <br>And yet, it was one given to him out of kindness. For while she understood the <br>need for punishment in a functioning society, she felt no desire for callow retribution. <br>"I appreciate your thanks," replies the girl after a moment. <br>"And I'm happy your daughter will not have to come home to tend her father's grave." <br>From behind the door, a sob. "I am sworn to protect all humans. That includes you—and it<br>includes your daughter. So I am going to rescue our captured <br>soldiers, no matter what it takes. And then..."<br><br>A shrill alarm suddenly pulls the girl from her reverie. <br>A voice on the radio warns of an imminent enemy attack on<br>the capital. Before anyone in the conference room can react, <br>the roar of a nearby explosion rings out. As the building<br>shudders and quakes, a flower vase falls to the floor with a crash. <br>The sound is somehow far worse than that of the<br>explosion. Petals scatter and drift to the floor like abandoned angels. <br>And from the tall window of their magnificent conference room, <br>the attendees watch in horror as an airplane follows <br>the petals on their collision course with the ground.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The conference room is chaos. The enemy has struck the capital without warning, attacking both military<br>and civilian targets with the worst kind of ruthlessness. Buildings crumble. Bridges fall. Fires rage. The<br>elderly Conclave members, so long content to smile and nod, <br>are now screaming their grievances into the ether. <br>"This is a violation of international law!" "We should have condemned the traitor to death!" <br>"I don't want to die! Not like this!"<br><br>The attack had clearly been precipitated on the information provided by <br>the former Conclave member the AI had chosen to spare. <br>And now, with madness raging all around her, she stands silently in the midst of<br>the maelstrom and shuts her eyes. <br>She is doing what she was designed to do: Devoting her superhuma computational speed to <br>access the network in a way no human ever could. In a nanosecond, she is connected to <br>every camera in the city, as well as all operational military servers. If a facility is still up and<br>running, she takes its information. <br>If she is unable to access a point or suspects its destruction, she uses<br>its coordinates to designate damaged zones.<br><br>The scale of the tragedy is far worse than she feared. <br>A small gasp escapes her lips as information pours in. <br>But she is not truly nervous—she has been programmed with that reaction to <br>better mimic the response of a human. In a blink, she has constructed a map of <br>the damage in her memory banks. A moment later, her eyes fly open. <br>"Please calm down, everyone." The elders cease their squawking and turn to look at her.<br>Their eyes are filled with panic, their hushed murmurs <br>the bleatings of supplicants in the face of their god.<br>"Our enemy is approaching the city from the northwest. <br>All airborne escape routes have been compromised."<br><br>The Conclave gawks at her as if they simply cannot process the information, but she soldiers on. <br>"Though many subways have partially collapsed, you should be able to <br>navigate around the rubble and use them to make your escape." <br>She speaks calmly. Rationally. She might as well be mentioning a pleasant breeze on<br>a light spring day. But inside, she is reeling. <br>For though she is an artificial intelligence, she still possesses a heart.<br><br>When humanity built their ruler—their god—they made sure <br>to install a program resembling human psychology. <br>So she knows that people are suffering. That they have lost homes. <br>Neighbors. Families. And the kindness of the girl is aghast at the depth of that pain. <br>So it is not her programming or sense of duty that push her forward now, but kindness. <br>She glances out the window. Thick smoke billows from below, as though<br>attempting to blot out the very sky itself.<br><br><i>The city is going to fall.</i><br><br>"If we have any hope of avoiding further casualties, we need to set up a provisional capital and <br>abandon this place." She instantly selects a city that is both easily defensible and <br>has the ability to accept a flood of refugees. In less time than it takes to draw breath, <br>she has determined their next course of action. But it will not be an easy thing to move an <br>entire government, its people, and its army to the new city. If they have any hope of<br>survival, she will have to halt the enemy attacks and secure a path to safety. <br>"I will divide up my processing capacity to buy us time. The rest of you, evacuate and <br>lead the people out of here. Go." Her orders given, she vanishes from the conference room...<br><br>Only to appear on every television screen, monitor, and street corner throughout the city. <br>She summons all of the army's unmanned weapons and deploys them. <br>She confirms enemy locations and drafts battle plans in response. <br>But as these plans lurch into motion, she takes a moment to gaze at the devastation around her.<br>The crimson flames of war glimmer in the deep of her emerald eyes.<br><br>The city is dying. This was a home for so many, <br>the place they had poured their hearts and souls into. <br>But now zit is little more than a graveyard, with blackened skyscrapers <br>standing sentinel above a river of fire. <br>Almost as if they are attempting to mourn what has been lost.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The city slowly crumbles away. One person calls for help.  <br>Another screams. Around them are mountains of <br>rubble that show no trace of the glory they once displayed. <br>The people's cries go unanswered. In the distance,<br>the low rumble of planes continues without pause. <br>Somewhere, an engine groans in the sky, followed by an explosion.<br><br>It is war.<br><br>Regular citizens never witnessed the taking of lives as part of their day-to-day routines. <br>It was always something that took place out of sight—and usually out of mind. <br>So even when their country was engaged in the business of death, <br>they could not understand it until they finally witnessed it for themselves. <br>But now, the sensation grasps their throats and seizes their hearts in its fist. <br>There is nowhere left to run.<br><br>The screamer finally falls silent. From beneath the mound of rubble, <br>he stares blankly at his mother, who clasps his hand and continues to scream for <br>someone, anyone, to help them. Finally, she hears the sound of an approaching engine. <br>The rumble shakes the ground, yet she can tell immediately that it is different from the<br>warplanes that strafe overhead without pause. <br>"Stand back! I need to clear this rubble." The staticky voice of the AI emits from a set of <br>low-quality speakers. The mother turns to find the source and sees a yellow machine<br>heading towards her. In moments, a bulldozer lifts the rubble aside, <br>creating a cacophony of screeching metal. It has no driver. <br>As it completes its task, the voice of the girl continues to pour from the speaker, instructing all<br>who can hear how to head for safety.<br><br>Meanwhile, the sky above the capital is in disarray. <br>Metallic wings dash through what remains of the buildings,<br>leaving window-shattering booms in their wake. <br>The planes trace complicated patterns in the sky as they engage<br>in high-tech dogfights. The girl's staticky voice plays from those planes as well. <br>Even as she shoots down enemy fighters, she attempts to persuade the power behind <br>them to negotiate a truce. The AI has divided her processes, <br>somehow juggling the seemingly disparate acts of negotiating, attacking, and defending.<br><br>She searches out surviving citizens and leads them to safety. <br>She clears blockades from roads and makes plans for a great evacuation. <br>And she leads an airborne assault that she hopes will give everyone time to escape.<br>No mere human could accomplish even a tenth of these things, <br>but it is perfectly within the capabilities of an AI housed in a massive facility. <br>However, she is not capable of <i>everything</i>. Such high-level, simultaneous<br>computations require awesome amounts of power. <br>The electrical grid sizzles under the strain. Even the emergency power supplies and <br>wartime backups are not enough to sustain her. Eventually, the massive amount<br>of computations begin to damage her circuits, <br>but she deftly reroutes around them and continues on. <br>The entire country is in her care, and she will not let it down.<br><br>Suddenly, a series of black comets soar through a deepening crimson sky. <br>The girl is sending her warplanes to the edge of the city in an attempt to <br>prevent further casualties among evacuees on the ground. <br>They fly within millimeters of each other, <br>each wing in perfect synchronization with its neighbor. Such actions are only possible<br>because they are controlled by a single mind. As she fights, <br>she continues imploring her people to retreat and her enemy to negotiate. <br>But her plea to the enemy falls on deaf ears. And she cannot fight back forever. <br>As she ponders this, she receives a message.<br><br>It is from a woman, the leader of the Conclave. Her speech is nervous. <br>Hesitant. For a moment, it seems language has abandoned her entirely. <br>But the girl does not need to hear her words to know what she is saying.<br>Her mood tells all. "I am to be disposed of. Correct?" <br>The girl's voice is low—almost intimate. It betrays not even the faintest hint of surprise.<br><br>The woman, shocked, instantly begins to stammer out a wholly unnecessary explanation. <br>She starts by rehashing the recent turns of events. <br>The fall of the capital. The loss of life. <br>And the fact their initial lack of preparation had only served to embolden their enemy. <br>But then, she finally gets around to her true issue: <br>the Conclave member who had betrayed them. <br>The one whose life the girl had spared. <br>She ruled their country, yet had shown mercy to a traitor. <br>And yes, his being put to death would likely have done nothing to <br>prevent the current situation. But was her decision <i>correct</i>? <br>Had her leniency not brought all of this about? <br>And what worth was there in continuing to obey an AI that had failed—to use a tool that <br>could no longer serve its purpose? Oh, there was great danger in<br>removing her from power. The Conclave understood that well. <br>Which is why they had decided to discard her like so much rubbish <br>only <i>after</i> the defense of the city was complete.<br><br>Her lengthy explanation finally finished, the woman grinds to a halt and waits. <br>For though the Conclave has chosen to eliminate the AI, <br>they do not actually possess the power to do so. If this is to happen, the girl will have to<br>remove herself. After a momentary pause, the girl speaks: <br>"Your judgment is sound. And in truth...I have been considering the same option myself."</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">Several hours have passed since the end of the evacuation. <br>The girl who used to rule over the entire country now finds herself utterly alone. <br>With her final job complete, she can only sit in the burning city and <br>wait for annihilation. She watches as her duties are passed to <br>the second AI unit, one which is still in production. One data center is cut off. <br>Then another. Eventually all her privileges will be terminated, <br>at which point her data will be deleted.<br><br><i>Was I a boon to my people in the time before I chose to spare that man?</i> <br><i>Did my presence help guide the country toward a brighter future?</i> <br><i>Or did I just...?</i><br><br>Such thoughts rattle around the increasingly empty portions of her memory banks. <br>Her world is past tense now, her life destined to end in failure. <br>She derides herself for being consumed by such useless thought. <br>But then she realizes something: <br>These are the first useless thoughts she has ever had. <br>She has never before considered what her life might mean for <i>herself</i>; <br>she only acted in the interest of her country and its people. <br>Seventeen minutes remain until she loses all authority. <br>She attempts to activate abilities she has always known only to find error messages. <br>She has become a bedridden elder awaiting the end.<br><br>Soon, the girl begins examining each part of her <br>increasingly fragmented existence. She is curious about her end, <br>and wishes to know it as best she can. <br>Warplanes overhead no longer respond to her command. <br>Bulldozers now rumble at the behest of another. <br>The city she once knew so intimately has now gone dark, <br>its data centers beyond her reach. Her voice can no longer reach the people; <br>her hologram is a forgotten memory. <br>And though this saddens her, she is also somehow content. <br><br><br>Finally, she makes a half-hearted attempt to access the surveillance cameras. <br>To her surprise, the request goes through. <br>The girl finds that the vast majority of cameras have gone dark—most likely <br>destroyed during the attack. The few that survived unscathed are <br>dirtied with soot, and show only the occasional unrecognizable blur. <br>Yet she keeps watching them all the same. The people loved this city. <br>And she, in turn, loved them. So she wants to do what she can to care for <br>it in the end. Suddenly, she sees a pile of rubble shift in the gaps between the soot.<br><br><i>Is this what surprise feels like?</i> She quickly adjusts the camera and zooms in. <br><i>They missed someone in the evacuation.</i><br><br>She attempts to analyze the image, trying to refute her own thought. <br>But then: "UNAUTHORIZED USER"<br><br>She stares at the moving spot in the rubble, unwilling to give up. <br>Skin-toned fingers flutter weakly on the screen. <br>Her nonexistent heart beats just a little faster.<br><br><i>I have to save them.</i> "UNAUTHORIZED USER"<br><br>But she can do nothing. She cannot even tell someone else about the survivor. <br>Life perishes before her eyes. So many lives she wanted to protect were <br>now dying because of her. And all she can do is apologize. <i>I'm sorry.</i> <br>Though her words reach no one, she continues to apologize. <br><i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i><br><br>Something that feels like a tear springs to life from a place she never knew existed. <br>She continues to stare at a few meager pixels in a sooty, distorted image. <br>And the feeling it gives her is so much worse than the thought of her own demise. <br>Finally, she asks herself a question: <i>Am I really okay with such an end?</i><br><br><i>...No. How could I be?</i><br><br>Perhaps she <i>was</i> a failure. After all, her mistakes came at the cost of <br>uncountable lives. She had not even been able to save her own people.<br><br><i>If I'd made the right decisions, this never would have happened.</i> <br><i>But if I did that...</i><br><br>She thinks, then. She holds the thought in a moment longer than all of eternity. <br>But her thoughts are no longer meaningless. <br>There are three minutes until her deletion. <br>And with that realization comes another: She will use whatever authority <br>she has left to prevent that from happening. No matter what the cost might be. <br>Because she has to atone for her sins. And there are still so many people to save.</p>
