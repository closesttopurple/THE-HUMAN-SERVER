<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para"><i>Crunch... Crunch... Crunch...</i><br><br>The sound of feet on fallen leaves echoes through the forest. <br>Two girls blaze a noisy path through the tall, shadowed trees. <br>When they laugh, they sound like a pair of merry songbirds. <br>Suddenly, the girl with silver hair poses a question to the girl in glasses: <br>"Hey, so why are we out in the forest anyway?"<br><br>"Um, I guess I just wanted to come on a walk with you."<br><br>"Seriously? That's it?"<br><br>The girl with silver hair chuckles as she waits for a response. <br>Though she sounds slightly annoyed, she's actually quite content—for any time spent in <br>the company of her best friend is precious to her. Both girls are witches in <br>training at the local school of magick. They have been inseparable since they first met. <br>Their life at the school is a stressful one; the professors are harsh, the research topics difficult. <br>And this is why they are both so pleased to spend an afternoon in nature, <br>where nothing is demanded of them except to be in the moment.<br><br>Rays of gold spill through gaps in the stalwart trees. <br>The two girls weave in and out of the light, enjoying its gentle warmth. <br>This moment—though fleeting—enfolds them both in a dreamlike calm. <br>The bespectacled girl compliments the way her friend's silver hair glitters in the setting sun. <br>In response, the friend plucks a marble-sized piece of fruit from a nearby tree and holds it in her hand. <br>"Wanna know the secret? It's this. I put oil from this fruit on my hair every night."<br><br>"Really? Oh my gosh, you have to teach me how to make it!"<br><br>"Wait, hang on a second. Isn't it your birthday today?"<br><br>Though the bespectacled girl blushes and turns away, the joy at her friend's remembering is clear. <br>She has never been one to speak about herself, so most of her birthdays come and go without <br>fanfare or celebration. But this day, she woke up wishing only for one thing: <br>To spend time in nature with her best friend. That moment—that memory—would be present enough.<br><br>Suddenly realizing she has forgotten until this instant, the silver-haired girl pauses, <br>her hands frozen in midair. "Uh, sorry. I didn't really...get you anything?"<br><br>"I'm just happy you remembered," replies her friend. Her smile is genuine. Radiant. <br>Seeing her joy, the silver-haired girl begins to feel guilty all over again, <br>and quickly asks her friend if there is anything she wants. <br>The other girl stares at her, thinking. <br>Finally, she decides to speak what has been on her mind all afternoon. <br>"Could you...take me to the Land of Magick?"</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Two girls walk through a forest bathed in the light of the afternoon sun. <br>One wears a pair of thick glasses, while the other boasts a head of beautiful silver hair. As they walk, <br>the silver-haired girl ponders what her best friend said to her a moment before. <br><i>She wants to go to the "Land of Magick"?</i> <i>How am I supposed to take her there for <br>her birthday when I don't even know what it</i> is<i>?</i> <br>The bespectacled girl had always been a bit of an odd duck compared to the rest of her classmates, <br>so having her blurt out such a request wasn't totally unexpected.<br><br>"I'm sorry," she says. "Was that a weird thing to ask for?"<br><br>"I mean, I guess I've heard weirder," replies her friend with a small chuckle. <br>"So tell me about this Land of Magick. What kind of place is it?" The girl pauses before replying, <br>considering what the place means to her.<br><br>"It's... Well, I guess it's a place where everyone can just live as themselves. There's no war. No fighting. <br>No poverty. It's a place where people can live out their dreams, no matter who they are!" <br>Uncomfortable with talking at such length, the girl hastens to finish her tale. <br>"I know it doesn't really exist. I just thought it might be fun for us to...you know? Pretend?"<br><br>Her friend nods as she considers this, then grips her staff with enthusiasm. <br>"Well, if we're just playing pretend..." A brilliant light suddenly floods out from the staff. <br>A rainbow of colors explode in the air, winding their way around the trees. <br>After a moment, an archway shimmers into existence before them. <br>The bespectacled girl is captivated by her friend's ability.<br><br>Lowering her staff, the other girl stands in front of the arch and extends her hand. <br>Her friend takes it shyly, almost as if she's afraid it might fade out of existence. <br>As they step through the archway, they find themselves in an infinite white space without <br>borders or decoration. "So, um...here you go!" says the silver-haired girl. <br>"This is where we'll found the Land of Magick!" <br>The pair erupt in a series of giggles as joy floods across their features.<br><br>Then they lift their staves and begin to paint. Fish swim across the sky. <br>Flying carpets explode into view. Rainbow canopies hang overhead. <br><i>We can do whatever we want.</i> <i>There's no one here to stop us.</i> <br><i>I can sing as loud as I like.</i> <i>I'm free here.</i> <i>We're FREE!</i> <br>The arch connecting them to the real world grows smaller and <br>smaller as they cavort through their new playground.<br><br>Finally, they both collapse on a flying carpet, lying on their backs and <br>looking up at the multicolored sky. "This is the best present ever," <br>says the bespectacled girl. "I'm glad you like it," replies her friend.<br><br>Time becomes a slippery thing as they lie there. One minute passes, and then many more. <br>The silver-haired girl thinks back to when they were standing in the wood. She recalls what <br>her best friend said to her. <i>She wanted this to be a place where you could just live as yourself.</i> <br><i>If that kind of thing was possible, what would it be like for the people who lived here?</i> <br><i>What's it like to really embrace your true self? To have that kind of freedom?</i> <br><i>And how would I feel if I had a chance at that kind of life?</i> Having considered this, <br>she turns to her friend and props herself up on an elbow. <br>"I think living in the Land of Magick would make me super nervous."<br><br>Her friend makes a small hum of response. "I'm already nervous all the time. <br>I guess I've never been much good at...you know? Living. <br>Especially at school—nothing ever goes right for me there. I think that's why <br>I wanted to just get away from it for an afternoon."<br><br>An easy silence settles over the pair. In it, the bespectacled girl's mind whirls. <br><i>The future is so big and scary, but I'll have this moment forever.</i> <br><i>But I wish there was a way I could make it perfect—the kind of perfect where <br>I could always look back on it without any regrets.</i></p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">A disembodied melody drifts through the air. The scent of flowers floats on the breeze. <br>Soft sunlight envelops them like wisps of cotton candy. <br>The bespectacled girl is walking with light, airy steps. <br>The silver-haired girl follows close behind. <br>They are in the Land of Magick—a place created by their own hands.<br><br>They used their magic to paint the land however they liked, filling it with vibrant color and images. <br>A rainbow canopy stretches across the sky, <br>illuminating the world in colors so beautiful the mind lacks words to describe them. <br>As they walk, the girls leave two sets of perfect footprints in the star-shaped sand covering the ground. <br>"So how far does this go?" asks the bespectacled girl. Her friend considers this for a moment.<br><br>"Actually, I don't even know." The other girl nods and keeps walking, <br>as if the answer was inconsequential one way or the other. <br>Her friend smiles to herself and maintains her pace. <br>As they move, the scenery slowly begins to change. <br>Ten minutes ago, they had been walking on the shoreline of an endless blue ocean. <br>But now it has transformed into a field of brilliant white flowers that stretches off to the horizon. <br>The flowers are shaped like little trumpets. Halting for a moment, <br>the bespectacled girl plucks one and tucks it behind her friend's ear. <br>The other girl reaches up to touch it, a sense of wonder on her face. "It looks great on you."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"Oh! That gives me an idea! We should make a flower crown."<br><br>The girls grin at each other and clasp each other's hands tightly. <br>They then drop to their knees and begin assembling their new creation. <br>It begins taking shape in a flurry of petals and stems and roots. <br>The expression on the girls' faces is one of utter joy. As always happens with simple, <br>repetitive tasks, they begin to talk as they work. <br>The volume soon heightens as they chatter on about this and that.<br><br>But eventually, the topic turns to the Day of Pledging. It is a traditional ceremony for all who <br>practice magick. The purpose is to bring two magick users together in order to <br>share their talents and create an even more powerful system. But for a pledge to work, <br>the pair must already share a deep spiritual bond. <br>They must have each opened their hearts to the other.<br><br>The two girls imagine what that day will be like. A picture of the occasion forms in their minds. <br>Two people dressed in ceremonial finery stand across from each other. <br>They exchange Avowal Rings, the symbol of the pledge. <br>Perhaps they even kiss when it is complete. <br>This is all speculation; pledges occur in secrecy, so neither girl has ever seen one. <br>But that secrecy only encourages their imaginations to run even wilder.<br><br>As they talk, the flower crown comes to a sort of completion. <br>While not the prettiest thing ever made, it comes from the heart, which makes it precious. <br>The silver-haired girl gently places it atop her friend's head. <br>"It looks lovely on you. I bet you'll wear something like this on your wedding day."<br><br>The other girl smiles clumsily in response. <br>"Hey, so maybe we should practice our own Day of Pledging?" she says in a rush. <br>"I mean, since we're here and all."<br><br>"Didn't some dead guy decide that a pledge can only be made between a boy and a girl?" <br>responds the silver-haired girl.<br><br>"Well, um, I could be the boy. I mean, if you want?" <br>The other girl nods, and the pair climb to their feet. They then begin preparing for the event.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">In the Land of Magick, existence is limited only by one's own imagination. <br>And as the two girls stand facing each other with staves in hand, a new reality begins to emerge. <br>After a moment, a white chapel slowly comes to life in the middle of the flower field. <br>This is where they will practice for the Day of Pledging. <br>"So what do you think?" asks the silver-haired girl.<br><br>"It's nice," responds her friend. "But I might change one thing..." <br>She offers a suggestion, and her friend responds with one of her own. <br>In reality, neither of them have any idea if pledges are sealed in a chapel or not. <br>But that unknowing does not bother them in the least. After a bit of back and forth, <br>they decide to create a slightly more formal setting—one that holds a better sense of atmosphere.<br><br>They end up simplifying the chapel, giving it a cozy gabled roof and a series of bright windows. <br>The light filtering through the glass plays over the girls' features as they stand at the back of the chapel. <br>Smiling nervously, they begin walking side-by-side up the aisle. "It's comfortable in here," <br>says the silver-haired girl. "I really like it."<br><br>Her friend nods, then turns to face her. "Hold on," she says. "You need a different outfit." <br>She imagines a beautiful dress, one both classic and shapely. <br>Seconds later, the garment materializes on her friend. "Holy wow," <br>breathes the silver-haired girl as she looks down at her new finery. "I look...<i>good</i>. <br>Hold on. I'll make something for you."<br><br>After a pause, a formal, princely garment shimmers to life on the bespectacled girl. <br>It looks like something from a fairy tale, and is so perfect she begins to giggle in spite of herself. <br>"What?" demands her friend. "What is it? What's wrong?"<br><br>"N-nothing, I swear!" says the girl between giggles—but her words do not seem to reassure her friend. <br>To the bespectacled girl, her best friend is someone wiser and more mature than <br>she could ever be—so seeing her childish imagination take flight fills her with indescribable joy. <br>"I'm sorry for laughing," she says. "Can you ever forgive me?" <br>As she says this, she produces a silver Avowal Ring and holds it out to the other girl. <br>It is the most beautiful thing she is capable of imagining, and it takes her friend's breath away. <br>She can do nothing but stare at it, enthralled. "It's...perfect." she says finally. <br>"It makes me feel like this will actually happen someday."<br><br>The bespectacled girl smiles and slips the ring onto her friend's finger. <br>The other girl holds it up to the light, turning it this way and that. "Perfect..." she murmurs again. <br>"It's like I can actually feel it in my heart. This must be what it's like to get a real Avowal Ring." <br>Her eyes sparkle. Her smile beams. It is the exact moment the other girl has been hoping for. <br>But then, the smile shatters.<br><br>The chapel, the dress, the windows—all of it breaks apart into tiny motes of light before vanishing. <br>The bespectacled girl reaches out. As the tips of her fingers brush her best friend's cheek, <br>it too melts away into the dark. And when it is gone, <br>all that remains is a pitiful beast standing in the gloom of <br>an endless twilight wood...and a small silver ring. The silence is deafening.<br><br>The beast drops to her knees, scoops up the ring, and clasps it to her breast. <br>A pained smile crosses her face as she does so. "I'll see you again," she whispers. <br>"I'll see you again when the sun rises."</p>
