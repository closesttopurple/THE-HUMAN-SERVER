<p class="title">Chapter 1: Will I Be Like That One Day? (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">Every student in school is<br>looking at the girl with wavy<br>hair. She stands tall and bold<br>on the podium as she receives<br>a commemorative gold watch from<br>a professor.<br><br>She is my best friend. <br><br>"You used the knowledge and<br>power you gained from your<br>lessons to save the townsfolk<br>from monsters. Everyone here is<br>proud of your bravery." <br><br>She stands at the center of the<br>world as the students give her<br>a generous round of applause.<br>She shines under the auditorium<br>spotlight. She is breathtaking.<br><br>...And she feels so distant.<br><br>When the teacher dismisses us,<br>students crowd around her and<br>sing her praises, but I can't<br>bring myself to approach her.<br>After all, I'm a klutz.<br>I'm stupid. I'm gloomy.<br><br>I'm not the person for her<br>at all.<br><br>Dark feelings slowly consume<br>me, and the next thing I know,<br>I'm dashing out of the academy.<br>With nothing better to do,<br>I wander about the courtyard.<br>It's not much of a courtyard—<br>more like a forest with<br>overgrown trees everywhere—<br>but the crisp air helps me<br>feel a little bit better.<br>Sometimes all I want is to be<br>in empty places like this. <br><br>"Hmm?" <br><br>I suddenly spot a building I<br>don't recognize beyond the<br>trees: a shabby stone hut.<br>It's too large to be a<br>toolshed, but just big enough<br>for someone to live inside.<br>And since the door sits ajar,<br>I decide to peek inside.<br>It's dark and cool, with a<br>faintly weird smell. I need to<br>go farther in to get a better<br>look, so I step forward and...<br><br>"My my!" says a voice as<br>candlelight blooms in the<br>dark. "It's not every day a<br>student from the academy<br>finds their way in here."<br><br>"Eeep!" is my clever reply.<br>The speaker is an old man in<br>a chair sitting next to a table<br>with a small candle on it.<br>He looks at me and lowers his<br>eyes in a somber fashion.<br><br>"Welcome to the house of the<br>dead, dear girl. Welcome to<br>the morgue."<br><br>"The...morgue?"<br><br>"Indeed. This is the resting<br>place of all former students<br>who die in battle and have no<br>one to claim their remains." <br><br>As he says this, my eyes<br>adjust to the light enough<br>for me to realize the room is<br>filled with rack after rack<br>of bodies. There are so many,<br>and some are horribly mangled.<br>To think they all used to go<br>to this school... <br><br>"Poor things. There's no one<br>left to mourn them." <br><br>I'm terrified, but my feet<br>are rooted to the spot. I know<br>many students at the school<br>are estranged from their<br>families—including me and my<br>two best friends—and I never<br>once considered that after I<br>finally leave the school, we<br>would simply end up right<br>back here in death.<br><br>As I roll this thought over in<br>my mind, a loud thud rings out<br>from beyond the candlelight's<br>reach. I squeal again as I see<br>a number of former students'<br>corpses emerge from the dark.<br>Their lifeless bodies stagger<br>and groan as they march slowly<br>toward us.<br><br>"Ah, but this is no good,"<br>says the old man. "Run,<br>little one! Run now!"<br><br>I do just that, burst out of<br>the morgue and into the<br>safety of the trees. I hear<br>corpses groaning behind me,<br>and the sound terrifies me.<br><br>And yet...<br><br>It almost sounds like weeping.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Trusting My Power (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">Even after I returned to my<br>room, I couldn't shake the<br>image of the corpses I saw in<br>the morgue. I tried to understand<br>what had happened, and how<br>it was possible for them to be<br>moving. And then, a thought<br>sprang into my mind:<br><br><i>Black magick</i>.<br><br>Black magick is a set of<br>forbidden spells used by only<br>a small number of mages.<br>And while the price for their<br>failure is great, they can<br>accomplish things regular<br>spells cannot. When we learned<br>of black magick in our History<br>of Magick class, our professor<br>told us of a spell that<br>enslaved deceased people to<br>the will of the user, then went<br>on to claim some opposing <br>nations take great joy in<br>wielding such horrid spells.<br><br>The look on my best friend's<br>face when she heard that was<br>one of utter disgust. She<br>shook with anger as tears<br>spilled from her face, then<br>balled her fists and swore to<br>never engage in so foul an<br>undertaking.<br><br>Her tears were beautiful, and<br>the sentiment perfectly her;<br>she never could ignore those<br>who suffered from injustice.<br>If she had found the morgue<br>instead of me, she wouldn't<br>have run away and left them<br>to their fate. Instead, she<br>would have used her amazing<br>spells to undo the black<br>magick and permit the poor<br>dead to have their rest.<br><br>If only I could be like her...<br><br>I remember how brightly she<br>shone under the auditorium<br>spotlight. She was so far <br>above me, even the thought<br>of reaching her was laughable.<br>But if I could save the poor<br>corpses in the morgue? If I<br>could help people in need?<br>Well, maybe I could be one<br>step closer to her. <br><br>It was an idea powerful<br>enough to inspire even a<br>coward like me. <br><br>The next day, I went in search<br>of my other best friend.<br>Though I hated to admit it,<br>I couldn't take on the corpses<br>in the morgue alone. I needed<br>his help for my plan to work. <br><br>Thankfully, he was easy to find;<br>his spiky hair made him stand<br>out almost as much as his<br>talent. Upon tracking him down,<br>I walked up and said,<br>"You're good at dispelling<br>magick, right?"<br><br>"Better than any other student<br>in this dang school, that's for<br>sure!" he said with a wry smile<br>and a charming air.<br><br>"Can you dispel black magick?"<br><br>"Never tried, but I know the<br>theory behind it.<br>Why do you ask?" <br><br>"I need to dispel some, but I<br>don't think I can do it alone,<br>so I was wondering if you—"<br><br>"Don't need to ask me twice!"<br>he cried with delight.<br><br>After class, we went to the<br>morgue. It lurked quietly in<br>its corner, just like the day<br>before—and as we stood<br>before it, the same familiar<br>fear came creeping over me. <br><br>The inside retained its<br>distinctive smell, and was<br>dark as a black cat at<br>midnight. As we stepped across<br>the threshold, we immediately<br>heard a series of groans—<br>and when I raised my staff to<br>light the room, we saw the<br>dead were already shambling<br>toward us. But my best friend<br>wasn't worried; he immediately<br>began to ready his anti-magick<br>spell, humming quietly.<br><br>I knew such things took time<br>to prepare, so I worked to<br>draw the corpses away by<br>setting off little fireworks<br>at their feet. It was a pretty<br>pathetic display of magick,<br>and nearly useless in a fight.<br>But if I lost heart now,<br>I'd never be able to consider<br>myself equal to my best friend<br>in the entire world, which is<br>what gave me the courage to<br>keep going.<br><br>Suddenly, a corpse lunged at<br>me, sending me toppling to<br>the ground. I couldn't bear<br>the thought of what was about<br>to happen, so I shut my eyes<br>and covered my head with my<br>arms. But then...<br><br>"Here we go!" <br><br>My friend lifted his staff in<br>the air, where it began to<br>emit a brilliant golden glow.<br>The spell quickly manifested<br>around the corpses in an<br>intricate circle, and as it<br>grew brighter, he recited the<br>final words of the spell.<br><br>"Okay. We're good now." <br><br>The light faded. The corpses<br>were now motionless in the<br>darkness of the morgue. Their<br>faces looked to be resting<br>peacefully, as opposed to the<br>enslavement that had plagued<br>them not moments before, but<br>perhaps I just imagined that. <br><br>"Our magick has finally<br>given them true rest." <br><br>The next thing I knew, my<br>companion was standing beside<br>me. For some reason, it made<br>me think of my other best<br>friend. Together, we prayed<br>from the bottom of our hearts<br>that our senior mages could <br>finally rest in peace.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: The Unthinkable (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">Noticing the light from the<br>dispelling incantation, the<br>guard approached the morgue. <br><br>"I just can't believe it,"<br>he muttered. "Two <i>students</i><br>undoing that dark magick?"<br><br>After the shock of seeing<br>corpses lying still as they<br>were meant to finally faded,<br>he praised us for being brave,<br>kind students. <br><br>My plan had gone so well that<br>I felt like I was in a dream,<br>and my best friend and I<br>remained in high spirits as we<br>walked back to the dorms.<br>The old guard's words made me<br>forget that I was usually weak and<br>timid. Instead, for a moment,<br>I felt like I was someone<br>special. And I thought that<br>maybe—just maybe—I'd grown<br>one step closer to <i>her</i>.<br><br>I wanted to tell her what<br>happened today. Would she<br>compliment me like the old<br>guard did? I could feel my<br>heart race as I pictured that<br>happening, but my reverie was<br>interrupted by my best friend.<br><br>"I don't feel like going home<br>yet," he said as he pointed to<br>the tallest building on campus.<br>"Wanna go up the bell tower?" <br><br>"Sure," I replied. We'd gone<br>up there many times when we<br>were younger, and I knew the<br>views to be quite beautiful.<br>High as I was on the thrill of<br>victory, the idea of being<br>above the entire world was<br>something I was eager to<br>experience again.<br><br>We reached the top of the<br>tower, which contained a bell<br>that was enchanted to ring at<br>certain times throughout the<br>day. From there, we could see<br>the forest that surrounded<br>both our academy and the<br>neighboring city of mages. <br><br>"It's such a lovely view,"<br>I said. I'd been scared of the<br>height when I first came up<br>here, but it didn't bother me<br>anymore. I felt like I was<br>stronger in that regard, which<br>only added to the joy that I<br>currently felt.<br><br>"Hey, listen," said my friend<br>as he sat beside me and stared<br>out blankly into the distance.<br>"I'm really glad your plan<br>worked. I was a little nervous<br>about it, but we made a pretty<br>great team in the end." <br><br>"I couldn't have dispelled<br>that black magick on my own,"<br>I replied. "Thank you."<br><br>He shook his head. "That's not<br>what I mean. I think you're<br>incredible for <i>wanting</i> to do<br>it in the first place."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Those dead students were<br>being forced to move, and you<br>wanted to save them. It was<br>so...kind, and I think that's<br>a great quality to for a<br>person to have."<br><br>I recalled how angry our other<br>friend was at the prospect of<br>black magick, even going so<br>far as to shed tears over it.<br>But now it felt like I and the<br>boy beside me had grown even<br>closer, which caused me to<br>blush in delight.<br><br>"We really are amazing<br>together, huh?" he continued.<br>"I mean, we were friends right<br>out of the gate, and now we've<br>been together all this time.<br>I don't think I've ever<br>stopped thinking about you." <br><br>My two best friends were so<br>talented. So capable. They<br>were always the ones helping<br><i>me</i>. Luck had brought me into<br>their orbit, but I never felt<br>like I belonged there. And<br>hearing him speak to me now,<br>I almost couldn't believe I<br>deserved it. <br><br>"I think it's destiny that we<br>met," whispered my friend.<br>He was always so relaxed,<br>so calm, but now he seemed<br>nervous. "Um, do you think so?<br>It can't be coincidence, and<br>so I want us to be together<br>for as long as we can." <br><br>I'd only ever wanted the three<br>of us to be together forever,<br>and his words strengthened<br>that resolve in me. "Yes!"<br>I cried. "Yes, I want that!"<br><br>His eyes snapped up to mine<br>as a brilliant smile bloomed<br>across his face. "That makes<br>me happy—it makes me so,<br><i>so</i> happy."<br><br>I meant to return his smile,<br>but before I could, his face<br>was approaching mine, and I<br>felt a tepid warmth pressing<br>lightly against my lips.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Not Supposed to Happen (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">It was a morning like any<br>other. I stepped into the<br>classroom, rubbing my sleep-<br>deprived eyes, and sat down<br>next to my best friend. <br><br>"Morning!" she said. "I didn't<br>see you at dinner last night.<br>You okay?"<br><br>I nodded, which seemed to sate<br>her curiosity. A moment later,<br>a new, chipper voice rang out.<br><br>"Morning, you two! You study<br>for your magick history test?"<br><br>It was our other friend.<br>The boy.<br><br>"Obviously," she replied.<br>"My review was perfect."<br><br>"Oh ho! Sounds like it's on."<br><br>"Give it up, champ. There's<br>no way you're beating me."<br><br>Their back and forth was as<br>flawless as always, and I was<br>much too slow to keep up.<br>It was odd how things seemed<br>so <i>normal</i>.<br><br>"Oh, yeah. We should check out<br>the new general store once<br>class is done today."<br><br>He suggested this as if the <br>idea had just come to him,<br>but my other friend shook<br>her head.<br><br>"Sorry, I've got something to<br>do. But you two go on ahead." <br><br>My chest clenched when she<br>said that. <i>Oh no.</i> As I<br>floundered for something to<br>say, she spoke up again. <br><br>"I'm obviously going to ask<br>for a souvenir, though."<br><br>I accepted this with a<br>swallow and a nod, not<br>wanting to upset her.<br><br>The new general store was so<br>full of things that I almost<br>didn't know what to get. And<br>though I felt uncomfortable<br>walking next to him, I still<br>had fun picking out something<br>for our other friend. But as<br>we walked home, he said<br>something that made me<br>freeze in my tracks: <br><br>"I was glad she didn't come<br>with us today."<br><br>"Why?" I whispered.<br><br>"Because we could be alone.<br>You feel the same, right?" <br><br>"I, um..."<br><br>I knew what I was going to say<br>next would wound him, but I<br>absolutely had to clear up<br>this misunderstanding before<br>it went any further.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I can't be with<br>you. There has to be someone<br>out there who's a better match<br>than for you than me."<br><br>My friend was silent. When I<br>finally summoned the courage<br>to look at him, I saw him<br>smiling faintly—which was not<br>at all what I was expecting. <br><br>"You really should be more<br>confident, you know?"<br><br><i>What is he saying?<br>I don't understand.</i> <br><br>"You're the perfect partner<br>for me."<br><br><i>What!?</i><br><br>"Still, it's cute when you<br>worry like that," He chuckled<br>at this, then opened his eyes<br>wide. "Oh, hey! I have a<br>present for you."<br><br>He reached out and placed a<br>flower-shaped pin in my hair.<br>I flinched in surprise and<br>jerked back, but he leaned<br>forward and whispered into<br>my ear.<br><br>"What? You thought I was<br>going to kiss you?"<br><br>"I..."<br><br>"We'll save that for some<br>other time." <br><br>His eyes belonged to a<br>stranger. His gaze felt sticky<br>as it moved up and down and<br>across my body, and it took<br>everything I had not to vomit<br>on the spot. It reminded me<br>how no matter how many times<br>I'd rinsed out my mouth<br>recently, I still couldn't<br>scrub the feeling from my lips.<br><br>"No..." <br><br>His whisper played in my ears<br>over and over and over and—<br><br>"No! I hate this! I HATE it!"<br> <br>Every place he touched me was<br>covered in filth. Every glance<br>caused my hair to stand on end. <br><br>"I'm gross! I'm dirty!<br>I'm disgusting! I hate it,<br>I hate it, I hate it,<br>I'm going to be <i>sick</i>!"<br><br>I took a pair of scissors and<br>jammed them into my bed over<br>and over. By the end of it,<br>my room was a disaster and my<br>throat raw from screaming,<br>but I still felt no better.<br><br>"Why...?"<br><br>If things went bad between the<br>two of us, what would happen<br>to me and <i>her</i>? Oh, but I<br>knew. She'd take his side—<br>of course she would. And then<br>we wouldn't be friends anymore. <br><br>"I don't want this..." <br><br>I was a fool to think I'd<br>gotten closer to her after<br>releasing the corpses in the<br>morgue from their curse.<br>I'd been happy in that moment,<br>but it now felt so very, very,<br><i>very</i> long ago.<br><br>I grabbed the flower pin and<br>threw it against the wall as<br>hard as I could. When I<br>pictured how things would go<br>in the days to come, I began<br>to sob as an ocean of tears<br>raged down my cheeks.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: What Hides in the Folds (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">Do you know the tale of the horribly ugly monster that lives<br>in the deep, dark wood⁠? The one that killed a hundred mages? <br><br>What sort of terrible form does it take, you ask?<br>Well⁠, they say it covers its entire body with cloth—<br>and that no one has ever seen its face!<br><br>...Goodness, it looks like me? Like Mama? Oh, you!<br>This white sheet is fashionable, I'll have you know. <br><br>But no matter how you try to hide your own inner ugliness<br>from others, you'll never be able to hide it from yourself.<br>And if you never face that part of you, you'll never find<br>salvation or an escape from it. <br><br>I wonder if the poor dear will ever realize that...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: The Mirror Spirit’s Incantation (No.06)</p>

<p class="para">"Yo, listen to this! I saw the<br>weirdest thing yesterday—<br>a big monster in a white sheet!<br>It was walking around outside<br>all night!" <br><br>"No way! Prove it"<br><br>"I swear it's true! It was<br>dragging around this big sack<br>and rubbing its eyes. I think<br>maybe it was crying?" <br><br>"Actually, my mom once told me<br>about a monster that brings<br>disaster and another monster<br>that brings happiness.

There are<br>over twenty or something."<br><br>"Nuh-uh! There are over<br><i>a hundred</i>!" <br><br>They giggled as they talked,<br>which was even more annoying<br>than the volume. I furrowed my<br>brow lightly as it continued.<br><br>"The one I'm talking about is<br>the good luck for pledges!" <br><br>"Never heard of that one." <br><br>"Yeah, so you carve your name<br>and the partner you want on<br>the edge of the bookshelf at<br>the very back of the library.<br>One of the older students did<br>it, and they next day she made<br>a pledge with the person she<br>always wanted!"<br><br>The shelf at the very back of<br>the library? Which one do they<br>mean? And if I etched my name<br>and <i>her</i> name on its face,<br>could we really...?<br><br>Even after the noisy girls<br>left, I had a hard time<br>concentrating on my books.</p>

It's a<br>dreamy and beautiful place, and my unease quickly melts<br>into joy as I step inside. <br><br>Suddenly, I'm overwhelmed by the stench of rotting flesh<br>and an absurdly large swarm of insects. Among the chaos,<br>I see the scattered bodies of students who wear the same<br>uniform as me.<br><br>Shocked, I leap backward and collide with a large mirror.<br>The enormous shadow within lets fly a fearsome howl as<br>it brings its fist down upon me.
