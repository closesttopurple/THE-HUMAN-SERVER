<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A metal arm stretches into the sky. Mechanical eyes soar through the air on colorless wings. <br>This is a city of science—the pinnacle of human evolution. <br>In their desire for ever-increasing progress, the people<br>turned their backs on the gods. <br>With science at their side, they come to doubt the mystical and the will of the<br>divine, finding understanding only in the cold logic of mathematical formulae. <br>Skyscrapers hold up gray clouds. Beneath its gloom, a colorful city glimmers in neon lights. <br>Within one building, an impatient fingertip swipes across a screen. <br>A single fretful researcher picks up an input device.<br><br>The room is dim; bright white light pouring in from <br>the hallway melts silhouettes within the dark. <br>The figures at the entrance are researchers, as is the person who operates the device. <br>To a man, they wear the same expression: unease. <br>Tongues move to form arguments and concerns. Voices rise and fall. Such quarrel<br>serves no purpose when their superiors have already <br>made their decision; it is merely a ritual to preserve rationality. <br>As they argue, their hearts are consumed by distrust and fear. <br>For though it means hastening their plans, they must awaken <i>her</i> before <br>the country is consumed by darkness.<br><br>The monitor shows a slumbering girl. Sounds worm their way into her sleep. <br>It's as if they are trying to force a bud to bloom in winter. <br>One is a deep, rhythmical noise akin to a church bell—a terribly inorganic sound.<br>Others are profane undulations that arrive and vanish without warning, <br>disturbing the rhythm. And finally, voices. Many voices.<br><br>Within the massive machine, the girl sleeps alone in her electronic cradle. <br>Her hair, glossy like wire, sways to and fro. She is the artificial intelligence so <br>desired by the people. Panicked fingers fly over keyboards in<br>an attempt to wake her as soon as possible. <br>But it is far too early in winter for such a bud to bloom. <br>Artificial intelligence. The country has granted leadership to <br>such creations for an age now. As science advanced,<br>people came to trust collective knowledge and outstanding <br>computation speed over human frailty.<br><br>So as she now wakes, her destiny is already writ in stone. <br>Tightly shut eyelids gradually loosen. As her consciousness sharpens, <br>so too do the sounds she hears. The rhythmical pulsing comes from a device<br>meant to wake her. But that sound has been disturbed by the others. <br>Dissonant tones. Questionable presence.<br>Silver lashes flutter in pain. <i>It is a warning. People are arguing.</i> <br>Her eyes open completely. "I..."<br><br>With a thought, she projects into the dark room as a hologram. <br>When the researchers by the door realize she is fully awake, they depart. <br>Almost as if they do not wish to see for themselves what happens next. <br><br>......<br><br>As the girl stands, she grasps for what she wants to say. <br>A wretched scream shakes the room. Some things cannot be contained in words. <br>The girl's hologram glitches. Blinks. Vanishes. A red light flares to life as a shrill<br>alarm begins to howl. As the artificial intelligence tries and fails to access her mind, <br>she writhes in pain. The alarm rings in her skull. Thirst roars in her throat. <br>She attempts to grasp what is happening, but her pain is so great she cannot even think. <br>All she comprehends is a warning composed of three words: "Element not found." <br>But she does not understand what that means; it is noise and fury, signifying nothing. <br>Writhing in pain and confusion, her hands reflexively reach up to her eyes. <br>But instead of making contact, the right one slides inside a hollow socket.<br><br>Such an empty cavern should not exist. <br>Formless fear races out from her fingertips and across her being. <br>She quivers with such intensity that it sends her to the floor. <br>Only then does she understand:  The constant warning in <br>her head tells her something is missing. In the face of this dreadful truth, <br>the girl slowly looks down at her trembling hands. <br>These are the first memories of her awakening.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">People abandoned horizons divinely bestowed upon them and <br>now see only a world bound in the cage of physics.<br>To keep advancing within that cage, humanity entrusts their course to machines. <br>For humans make mistakes— they overlook things. <br>And with their path left in the care of their own creations, heaven is no longer a divine domain.<br>Machines will stretch upward into the sky and look down upon all who toil beneath their watchful eye.<br><br>Minutes have passed since the AI's awakening. <br>Unable to escape her agony, the girl bears it with a quiet, stoic grace.<br>Somehow managing to hold onto consciousness, <br>she scans the red-light bathed room with her left eye. <br>Unending alarms. Pain. Incomplete activation. A missing right eye. And a lone researcher. <br>He seems to have his hands full,<br>shifting with uncertainty as he looks back and forth between the girl and the documents he holds. <br>After a moment, he takes a deep breath and focuses on her completely.<br><br><i>I want to get out of this situation as soon as possible</i>, <br>the girl thinks as she prepares to hear what he will say.<br>But the words that emerge from his mouth are wholly unexpected. <br>After apologizing for her early activation, he begins to explain the position their country is in. <br>The words are a jumble, leaving the girl bewildered. <br><i>What is he talking about?</i> As waves of pain crash over her, she listens.<br><br>Their country is currently at war with another. <br>A few days prior, the enemy launched a surprise attack, and the capital was lost. <br>While they managed to recover to a degree, they still took heavy damage and many losses. <br>The researcher falters occasionally as he speaks, but otherwise controls his emotions admirably. <br>They want her to assume control of the country and deliver them from their dire situation. <br>He begs the girl to order the rescue of their prisoners of war.<br>He says it is what the people desire; how they can outsmart their enemy. <br>And he claims the plan was in place before the attack. <br>As he makes to continue, the AI holds up a free hand.<br><br>"Wait."<br><br>Science is the foundation of their country. <br>Though kings and gods usually serve as the center of human communities,<br>here it is artificial intelligence. As such, she understands why the timeline of <br>her activation has been accelerated.<br>But there are two immediate problems: First, there are gaps in her information. <br>Though recently awakened, she has<br>knowledge that was previously saved in her memory banks. <br>According to it, there should be <i>another</i> artificial<br>intelligence she is to rule in tandem with—and yet, this does not appear to be the case. <br>Second, she is plagued by the red light in the room and the pain squeezing her every thought. <br>Clearly there is some manner of malfunction deep within her system. <br>Yet the researcher brings up neither of these things.<br><br>Both of these issues must be rectified if she is to have any hope of ruling effectively. <br>Things will end in disaster if she ignores them and simply hopes for the best. <br>Having processed this, she asks the researcher for an explanation as<br>to what is wrong with her. The pain hinders her operations; it gnaws at her like a rat. <br>She must end it as soon as possible.<br>But the researcher merely blinks at her question. <br>Though he is tasked with seeing to the awakening of the artificial<br>intelligence, he is incapable of grasping the truth of the situation. <br>Fear and distrust take root within her, spreading tendrils deep.<br><br>"Uh, let me check on that," says the researcher. He turns from her, picks up a small phone, <br>and is soon arguing quietly with someone on the other end. <br>Nothing about this seems honest. <br><i>What is happening in this country?</i> After speaking for a while, he finally turns to face her.<br><br>"Your missing element shouldn't be a problem. <br>If the pain and warnings are bothering you, I can stop them.<br>Now please, give the order!" He does not want to wait one moment longer. <br>She does not know how to respond to this;<br>the pain saps all pretext of rational thought. <br>The researcher taps something into the terminal, causing a false eye to<br>appear in her right socket. It is dummy data—a lie to hide the truth. <br>A way to pretend that what is missing actually exists, despite what she knows to the contrary.<br><br>The moment the eye is complete, the pain and warnings vanish. <br>But this does not mean the problem is solved. She can see nothing out of <br>her new eye—not even the distorted imagery which was there a moment ago. <br>The problem now hides in darkness, which only serves to heighten her anxiety. <br>But though it still lurks out there in the gloom, her job must begin. <br>And in this formless fear she now occupies, <br>she hasn't the slightest idea who—if anyone—she can trust.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Society is run by machines, humanity controlled by artificial intelligence. <br>For a time, this arrangement brings peace and tranquility. <br>The machines' decisions, backed by endless statistics, improve industry and manufacturing,<br>permitting nearly unchecked development. But when the skyscrapers came down in the attack, <br>they took the people's peace and tranquility with them. <br>The awakened AI—the governing girl—knows the people want to reclaim<br>their prisoners of war, and so launches the operation. <br>Though it is her first mission, she moves forward with the refinement of a veteran.<br><br>The country has collected reams of data throughout the war. <br>Once she is connected to the network, each bit of information will become another part of <br>her own experience. That ability—her strength—is the reason her people<br>cling so fiercely to the god that is artificial intelligence. <br>Several soldiers kneel before her hologram. "We finished installing the repeaters."<br><br>They are the vanguard, the ones who will head for the facility where the prisoners are being held. <br>"Understood," she says. "Did you learn anything new about the facility?" <br>She asks this so she might gather information from their report and choose the best course of action. <br>"Its interior is divided into small blocks, each of which is managed by a separate control system." <br>The soldier goes on to explain their fear of what will happen after the initial infiltration.<br>Connections between independent blocks—air vents as well as hallways—can be switched at any time. <br>This makes chemical weapons useless, and securing an escape route an incredibly difficult proposition. <br>In essence, they have no plan.<br><br>The girl closes her eyes and thinks. There are other things she must consider. <br>She had been awakened earlier than planned, then thrust into a situation of command. <br>All of this happened without any explanation as to why. <br>And she finds it difficult to believe it was done simply because the tide of battle left her country no choice. <br>With these thoughts in mind, she connects her consciousness to the database. <br>She will find her answers at the source.<br><br>Chaos has consumed the nation, and no one is willing or able to give her a satisfying answer. <br>Speaking with the researcher who activated her taught her this much. <br>The moment she connects to the network, she notices something.<br>Something <i>extremely</i> valuable. It concerns the other artificial intelligence that <br>was meant to work alongside her.<br>But when she attempts to locate it, she realizes the data has been intentionally erased. <br>She looks further and finally uncovers a single document. <br>It explains how the enemy attacked the city without warning, and lays blame for this<br>act squarely at the feet of the other AI. But she can find no answer as to <i>why</i>. <br>A chill runs up her nonexistent spine. <br>As of now, she has had no communication from her counterpart, which can only mean... <br><br>Just then, she finds another message. It is short—most likely a personal memorandum. <br>Perhaps that is how it avoided destruction. <br>"Once Unit One has been disposed of, we will activate Unit Two, <br>removing all elements believed to be responsible for Unit One's failure." <br>That is all it says. But it is enough to shock her into understanding. <br>Unit One was the artificial intelligence who ruled the country before she awakened. <br>And she was scrapped due to a failure. <br>This means she—Unit Two—is now singularly responsible for governance. <br>Additionally, she has been subjected to some sort of haphazard measure in <br>an attempt to prevent the mistakes of her predecessor.<br><br>This likely explains the missing right eye. <br>But no matter how hard she searches, <br>she cannot discern the function her absent part was meant to serve. <br>Multiple errors weave a tangled skein. A dizzying darkness overcomes her. <br>And then, a problem arises with the mission. <br>Prisoners who came in contact with the vanguard are causing internal strife.<br><br>The emotions they had been suppressing finally break free, and now they think only of <br>their own survival. As the commotion spreads, enemy soldiers spring to action. <br>She must act. One single failure can cause a domino effect of<br>tragedy. But as she ponders options, <br>she feels something dark swirl in the depths of her memory banks.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">Ideals. Hopes. Dreams. Humans thrust these things onto their machines and began to worship them. <br>They believed this to be more efficient than holding the ideals themselves. <br>They felt such powers unnecessary. And even though they may suspect what <br>has been lost in their most secret hearts, it is far too late to turn back now. <br>They have trapped themselves in a brilliant mechanical cage.<br><br>In the middle of the operation to rescue their prisoners of war, <br>the artificial intelligence is forced to make a decision.<br>The first prisoners to see the vanguard had informed others, <br>and now word is spreading like wildfire. <br>Enemy soldiers have caught wind of the plot and are mobilizing to action. <br>Her judgment must be swift. All will soon be lost. <br>As her soldiers wait for orders, the girl thinks of the most efficient action to take. <br>Finally, she thrusts a single finger upward.<br>"I will infiltrate the facility's control system. Wait for my signal." <br>As she speaks, an alarm sounds throughout the base.<br>Her soldiers do not know what she is thinking; all they can do is follow the quick, <br>precise movement of her finger's<br>trajectory.<br><br>The prisoners' panic grows under the alarm. Spurred on by the commotion, <br>the enemy redoubles their efforts to identify the cause of the situation. <br>The panels that divide the blocks move, creating several smaller rooms inside the facility.<br>She observes all of this through the many surveillance cameras she now controls. <br>She confirms the locations of the soldiers and prisoners, which is precisely where she predicted. <br>And for the first time, a faint smile crosses her face.<br><br>Deep within the building, a machine roars to life. It controls the air vents that connect the blocks. <br>The base is designed for both corridors and air vents to be cut off during an attack. <br>This was done so the enemy would have the ability to seal off and <br>vent any area that suffered a chemical weapon attack. <br>But it can also be used to control the amount of oxygen in the air. <br>The lower the oxygen levels, the greater the chance of ill effects—and eventually death. <br>This is her strategy. As the alarm continues to blare, one voice after another falls silent. <br>Though they appear to be sleeping peacefully, they will never wake again. <br>Soldiers and prisoners both.<br><br>The troops standing next to her stare wordlessly at the surveillance camera feed. <br>She turns to them with a smile."There is no reason for concern; I used the block systems to <br>ensure the most useful prisoners have the oxygen they need." <br>Her plan becomes clear: She had separated and sacrificed a portion of <br>the prisoners so she might save the most capable ones instead. In addition to r<br>escuing some of the prisoners, the ruthlessness of the plan is likely to<br>discourage the enemy from further attacks. She smiles again, <br>confident she has demonstrated her usefulness by <br>achieving the greatest results with the fewest losses. <br>But the soldiers only stare at her. They are not stares of approval, nor are they reproachful. <br>They are...strange. For what she does not know—what she did not learn—is that the<br>function of her missing right eye was to serve as a conscience. <br>The people now realize she is nothing like her <br>predecessor—and this knowledge <i>terrifies</i> them.<br><br>"Why are you looking at me like that?" They continue to stare. <br>She does not know what it means. As the moment stretches out, <br>she feels a stinging humiliation that only grows as <br>she realizes the discarded Unit One would understand what it meant. <br>But she cannot comprehend it, just as she cannot comprehend how others view her.<br><br>This is the beginning of her change. She alters the way she speaks. <br>She grows to detest failure and incompleteness.<br>Yet she keeps firm to her singular path in order to achieve her goal. <br>No one understands her. No one can. <br>And she does not even know how to wish for someone who could.</p>
