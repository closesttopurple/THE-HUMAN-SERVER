<p class="title">Chapter 1: Compare (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">Skyscrapers pierce a relentless gray sky. People input<br>destinations on their devices, relying on automated vehicles<br>to deliver them safely. This country has progressed so far<br>technologically that it is impossible to imagine a person<br>whose life does not benefit from it in some way.<br><br>This is our home.<br><br>Our lab, home to a massive computer terminal, is abuzz with<br>activity. Our supervisor has just barged in and demanded<br>that we compile data for the next meeting. The request<br>instantly makes me nervous; my head droops, my hands<br>shake. But in contrast⁠...<br><br>"Of course! We'll have it ready for you right away." <br><br>It's my coworker who speaks in that bright, cheery tone—<br>the coworker with the same face as me. As she downloads<br>the data and hands it to our supervisor with a smile,<br>he looks back and forth between the two of us in wonder.<br><br>"I just can't get over it," he mutters.<br><br>We glance at each other, grinning. Because we're twins,<br>you see—exactly the same in physique, height, and face.<br>The only thing that sets us apart is our hair: mine hangs<br>down to my lower back, while my sister's barely brushes her<br>shoulders. That hairstyle, combined with her bright and<br>cheerful demeanor, makes her seem far younger than she is.<br><br>Everyone loves her. She's clearly the best of us, yet she<br>never lets it go to her head—in fact, she goes out of her<br>way to help everyone else whenever they need it.<br><br>But me? Ha. No. I spend my days hiding in her shadow,<br>relying on her to communicate for the both of us.<br>I'm not outstanding in any way⁠; not as a researcher,<br>nor as a person. I'm just...there.<br><br>Yet despite our being complete opposites, we're working on<br>the same project in the same lab. So at least our hearts<br>are in the same place.<br><br>Our job is to develop artificial intelligence that supports<br>and guides people as they sleep, wake, prepare for the day,<br>eat, head to work or school, and look for entertainment and<br>happiness. Our mission is to help people, to protect them<br>from harm and give them a chance at a better future.<br><br>That said, all I've done so far is nod quietly and agree<br>with whatever ideas my sister comes up with.<br><br>That night, we're so engrossed in our research that the<br>hours slip by. So instead of trying to go home, we rest in<br>the laboratory's nap room. This isn't unusual; we can't<br>waste a single minute—a single <i>second</i>. Every moment<br>we aren't working is a moment another country is making<br>progress. We need to establish our technology and publicize<br>it as soon as possible, because if someone beats us to the<br>punch, they'll have the tech for themselves.<br><br>And yet, we still have to rest, so I swallow my impatience<br>and make a genuine effort to sleep.<br><br><i>Click.</i><br><br>A noise from the lab shatters my efforts. I sit up⁠,<br>wondering if my sister decided to forego sleep and return<br>to work. But as that thought crosses my mind, I see her <br>preparing to exit the nap room.<br><br>So what was the sound?<br><br>Careful not to wake our resting coworkers, we slip out<br>quietly and make for the lab, where we find an unfamiliar<br>man⁠—a unusual sight in a laboratory full of familiar faces.<br>He's quietly poking at the computer terminal, and I realize<br>instantly that he's some kind of foreign spy. <br><br>My sister clenches her fist and looks to me, her eyes<br>telling me to trust her. A moment later, the man looks up,<br>pulls a gun from his jacket, and points it at me. <br><br>But my sister gets to him first.<br><br>As the gunshot rings out, they collide. The bullet goes <br>wide, shattering a nearby glass cabinet. Broken shards rain<br>down around me, yet I remain utterly frozen with fear.<br><br>But my sister? No fear there. She's calm as can be. <br><br>She snatches something from the man and throws it to me.<br>It's data he copied from the console—data that contains all<br>of our ideals, our results, and our prayers. And the moment<br>it lands in my outstretched hand, she smiles at me. <br><br>"Go." <br><br>The man turns his attention to me, but my sister has no <br>intention of letting him approach. As she reaches out and<br>wraps herself around his legs, I realize she isn't going to<br>let go no matter how much he punches her. Or kicks her.<br><br>...Or shoots her. <br><br>"Help!" I cry as I run down the hallway. "HELP!" <br><br>Finally, the alarm wails and guards rush the area.<br>But my relief lasts for only the briefest of moments;<br>an instant later, pain tears through my body, followed<br>by a chill. It's a phantom sensation. I hear nothing.<br>See nothing. Yet I know the truth all the same.<br><br>My sister no longer lives.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Migration (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">We were twins—born the same hour of the same day, of the<br>same sex and face. We were exactly the same down to our<br>voices and genetic makeup, yet we were nothing alike when<br>it came to our talents and character. <br><br>My sister was great at everything she put her mind to,<br>which meant she always woke up way earlier than I did.<br>Sometimes she'd already have breakfast made for the both<br>of us by the time I woke up. That's why, even though we<br>lived together, I rarely saw her sleeping.<br><br>But now? Well, now I can watch her sleep all I want.<br><br>I've grown used to the sterile scent of this place.<br>Though visiting hours are ending, I work my way upstream<br>against the people heading home and venture farther in. <br><br>"Made it," I say cheerily. But as I pull the door open,<br>my faint hopes deflate; my only reply is the steady whirr<br>of the machinery surrounding a small bed in the corner.<br><br>"You up for some random work talk, Sis? Our research is<br>going pretty well." <br><br>The only color in the room comes from a single flower in a<br>small vase. As I change the water, I happily chatter away<br>to my slumbering sister, trying not to think about how<br>even though her wounds have healed, she still has no<br>idea what happened to her on that terrible night. <br><br>A foreign spy had attempted to steal the fruits of our<br>research⁠—data on highly-advanced artificial intelligence⁠.<br>But my sister caught him in the act; the thief was<br>apprehended, our data saved. And all it cost was her heart.<br><br>By the time help arrived, her heart had already stopped.<br>Now it's not even there anymore; instead, there's a machine<br>imbedded in her chest, one that uses ventilators and tubes<br>to keep up a desperate struggle for life. Her former<br>coworkers—the ones so familiar with her eternally smiling<br>face—turned away from the painful sight with tears in her<br>eyes the first time they saw it. They used to come see her,<br>in the beginning. But not so much anymore.<br><br>Naturally, our research became the focus of incredible<br>attention once people learned it was being targeted by<br>foreign forces, and I was soon invited to work at a more<br>prestigious laboratory—one where I could take up my<br>sister's research as well. And while the days are busy now,<br>my budget is essentially unlimited, which helps to dull the<br>sting. My new equipment lets me run wild on improving the<br>AI's data capacity without worrying about overloads or<br>downtime, and I'm well on my way to creating something my<br>sister and I once only dreamed of. Something...perfect.<br><br>At first, I didn't think there was any way I could finish the<br>project without my sister, but I now have so much money<br>and support that the thing practically runs itself. <br><br>It's almost like her not being here doesn't...matter?<br><br>That sounds heartless—I know it does—but there's an<br>incredible amount of responsibility on me now. I have<br>a mission to enrich people's lives and live up to my<br>country's expectations. I can't lose everything we'd<br>worked so hard for. Not now. Not after all this.<br><br>I reach out and touch my sister's cheek. As my finger<br>glides over bloodless skin, a smile naturally draws across<br>my face. My sister's cheek is ice cold, yet my fingers burn<br>hot. An impulse I've never felt before suddenly roils in the<br>pit of my chest. I can do this. I can keep walking forward<br>while making choices that lead to a more perfect future. <br><br>"You just rest, Sis. Okay? I've got this."<br><br>The only sound in the quiet hospital room is the hiss of<br>the ventilator. My shadow falls over my sister's sleeping<br>face. And as the sun finished its duty for the day and<br>lays itself to rest, the moon stirs and begins to shine.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Overwrite (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">One day, returning to the new laboratory after seeing my<br>comatose sister, I find my colleagues in a panic. It seems the<br>bigwigs came to observe, but a miscommunication meant<br>my coworkers had nothing to show for their work. Harried<br>for any sort of material, I hand the research directors<br>my storage device.<br><br>"I compiled these notes on my own time. Feel free to<br>use them." <br><br>I flash my brightest smile, and the director is delighted.<br>"How thoughtful," he says with a grin and goes to welcome<br>the group of VIPs. Drawn by an inkling of curiosity,<br>I glance over and notice my old boss among the group.<br>Upon seeing me, he rushes over, bewilderment on his face<br>as though he's seen a ghost. "All better now, I hope?"<br>he asks.<br><br>I shake my head. "I'm the sister," I say, to which he<br>heaves a deep breath. Whether it's from relief or<br>confusion, I cannot say.<br><br>"I barely recognized you with short hair. And considering<br>your state the last time we met, well..."<br><br>"What do you mean? I've always been like this." <br><br>My former boss's face tenses in embarrassment—perhaps<br>he realized his inappropriate question. He gives few words<br>of greeting as he makes his way toward the meeting room.<br><br>Good-natured, intelligent, considerate, devoted... Those<br>were all qualities that made up my sister. She could handle<br>everything herself, so even though we were twins, I always<br>found myself trailing in her shadow.<br><br>She could always predict the outcome of things as though<br>she was peering into the future—a testament to her<br>resourcefulness, knowledge, and careful analysis to arrive<br>at the truth. Like a machine, the answers came to her with<br>concrete data as her basis. The answers were right beside<br>me from the moment of my birth, so I never had the<br>opportunity to make any decisions myself.<br><br>The reason I wanted to become a researcher in the first<br>place was because of my sister's insistence. So long as I<br>was with her, I would always find the truth. So long as I<br>walked her path, I would never be led astray. Choice was<br>never a factor—I simply assisted her and lived a happy life<br>free of worries. And now, I must agree with my sister's<br>choice.<br><br>Days pass after seeing my former boss. The behavior of<br>the AI I'm working on grows unstable. No matter how much<br>I change the logical input values or its environment,<br>its tests return constant errors. Progress feels like<br>a thing of a long distant past, and I fall into a slump.<br> <br>"Perhaps you're just tired. You should get some rest." <br><br>"Maybe you'll find inspiration in what other people are<br>working on?" <br><br>My colleagues only fuel my irritation. "You don't understand<br>any of this!" I cry, and in that moment, I feel the world<br>crumble around me. Bewildered by my abrupt change, they<br>distance themselves from me like I'm a festering wound.<br><br>"I'm sorry, I...didn't mean it..." <br><br>My apology is reflective, but my voice is no louder than<br>the faint buzz of a mosquito. I find myself running out of<br>the lab and into the restroom. Impatience, guilt, and self-<br>loathing well up from the depths of my stomach and out of my<br>mouth. And even when I have no bile left to expel, it feels<br>like I still have so much more.<br><br>I muss up my hair, still a nuisance despite how short I've<br>made it, trying to ease the ever-present discomfort in my<br>chest. This impossible sense of helplessness is all because<br>of my sister.<br><br>I visit the hospital long after the sun sets to find<br>my sister's attending physician making his rounds.<br>Her condition is stable, he says. He then quietly leaves<br>the room.<br><br>My sister is pale, asleep, hooked up to a mechanical heart.<br>I stroke a finger over her cheek, just as I did that day.<br>Had that lab incident not happened, she wouldn't be lying<br>here. Surely she would have accepted her colleague's<br>advice with grace—no, knowing her, she never would've<br>gotten stuck in the first place. I thought I could complete<br>her research for her in her stead. But in the end, I could<br>never catch up to her.<br><br>I turn my gaze to the mechanical heart, the only thing<br>keeping her alive.<br><br>"If only..."<br><br>I taste iron as my teeth dig into my lips.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Option (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">A white light breaks through the darkness. Fighting gravity,<br>I peel open my eyelids. The chalky white ceiling gleams<br>softly in the morning sun, the shadows of the curtains<br>dancing across it like a stage.<br><br>I try to speak, but the breathing apparatus muffles my<br>voice. My arm hooked up to the IV is gaunt and frail. I want<br>to move my head, but my hair has grown long and pulls when<br>I try. Just how long was I out?<br><br>My attending doctor and nurses rush into the room, overjoyed <br>to see I'm awake. They inform me of my wounds—just how<br>serious they were, how close to death I was. How even though<br>my heart was ruptured, the power of machines kept me alive.<br><br>Ah, that's right. That man... He shot me when I tried to<br>protect our research data. Oh, my sister—<br><br>I ask the staff present how my sister is doing. There's<br>no telling whether they have answers, but I'm compelled<br>to inquire.<br><br>If she were all right, she would have visited. I know it.<br>So surely the nurses can tell me...<br><br>But my doctor's expression clouds.<br><br>"Your heart is no longer mechanical."<br><br><i>My heart? What about it?</i> But before my thoughts can<br>become words, I arrive at the answer. Though my mind feels<br>like cotton in my newly awakened state, I understand.<br><br>As I lay there in shock, he hands me an envelope. Familiar<br>writing on the front reads, "To my dearest sister."<br><br>Her writing is stiff but delicate. She spells out all her<br>worries, frustrations, and her love for me. She explains<br>how, after my injury, progress on the AI was going well,<br>but she eventually hit a wall. She wanted to continue with<br>our ideas, but she couldn't conduct the research on her own.<br>Every time she was struck by her lack of skill to carry out<br>the research, she wished it was <i>me</i>, not her, who was<br>still working. I could push forward our progress on the<br>research, she thought. So in the interest of our country,<br>our dreams...she gave me her heart.<br><br>Her relaxed writing soon grows messy and scratched but<br>becomes firm and resolute in the end.<br><br>"Please, live for me. I will love you forever<br>and always."<br><br>After a lifetime at the keyboard, she wrote her final words<br>by hand. I feel each word painfully and profoundly.<br><br>I crumple the paper in my hands, wrinkling it. My tears<br>spill over, blurring the ink. But I can't stop. The heart<br>pounding in my chest is my sister's. How much agony<br>did she endure? How hard was she pushing herself?<br><br>She followed me wherever we went ever since we were little.<br>She respected my decisions and always looked up to me.<br>So I always made choices for her. It was all to give her<br>a happy life free of worries.<br><br>Why, then, did she make such a grave choice?<br><br>She made the wrong choice—it goes without saying. Giving up<br>her own life for mine was wrong. But who drove her to make<br>that decision? Who pressured her so much she felt as though<br>she had no other choice? That much is obvious. It's me.<br><br>Had I not constantly taken away her opportunities to make<br>choices, things would not have ended up like this. What if<br>she hadn't grown to leave all judgment to me? It was my<br>own choices that led her to death.<br><br>The brilliant morning light streams into the hospital room,<br>shining upon the envelope. There's something else in it.<br>I reach inside and find a small data stick. I can<br>immediately tell what it is—her research data.<br><i>Our</i> research, what we risked our lives to protect.<br><br>A beacon for a brighter future with computational capability<br>beyond anyone's wildest dreams. With it, one will always<br>make the correct choice. Instantaneously.<br><br>People are flawed. If we let AI manage things and remove<br>ourselves from the decision-making equation, we will all<br>live much happier lives. I know it.<br><br>And I know my sister would never have ended up like she did.<br><br>I grip the data stick and press it to my heart. I will complete<br>our research. This is my mission, my atonement. We cannot<br>stop until we lead humanity toward a perfect future.</p>

Hogwash! You'd best update<br>your values soon, friend, unless you want to be left<br>in the past."<br><br>"Aw, but look at her! She looks just like that<br>singing hologram! A little smile would be great on her."<br><br>"If you think all women look the same, that only proves<br>you're just a silly old man!"<br><br>"Uh, no, honestly. Don't they look basically the same?"</p>
