<p class="title">Chapter 1: Shimmering Flames (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">The walls of the barracks shudder with the cheers<br>of soldiers holding a victory feast.<br><br>But in a storage room not far from the feasting hall,<br>I find the cooling body of one of my subordinates.<br>This is no accident—his throat has been slit neatly<br>with a knife, and his blue eyes are wide with regret. <br><br>                          *          *          *<br><br>Murder. Murder within the walls of our own base. <br><br>The military police begin to investigate the incident;<br>it's their job to maintain order in the army, after all.<br>A few days later, they tell me they suspect our problem<br>child is the killer. He went missing around the time of<br>the incident, and they've launched a search to find him.<br><br>The boy is a member of my squad, and I found things were<br>missing from his room—as well as bloodstains in the corner.<br>But when the MPs tell me they intend to shoot him on sight,<br>I can't let the decision stand.<br><br>"No," I say. "This course of action is entirely too hasty.<br>You must conduct a more thorough investigation." <br><br>No matter how much authority the MPs have, I can't let them<br>a soldier without trial—especially when they lack anything<br>but the basest of suspicions.<br><br>More importantly, the boy did not do this. I <i>know</i> he didn't.<br>As his captain, and as someone who has lived with him for an<br>extended period of time, I know. Sure, he can be a handful, but<br>he's a kind soul deep down, and not the type to slay a comrade.<br><br>When I carried him on my back after his injury in the last<br>battle, I saw him give his squadmates a trusting smile.<br>Faint, yes, but it was there.<br><br>Someone like him could never kill one of his own. <br><br>But no matter how much I insist, the MPs don't listen.<br>Quite the opposite, in fact: As the captain on duty during<br>the murder, I am suspended without pay for a month. <br><br>                             *          *          *<br><br>The sun has set, but I can't find it in myself to turn on<br>any lights. Instead, I stand listlessly in the middle of<br>my room, a being entirely without purpose. <br><br>Most of my days are spent like this now. <br><br><i>The boy is a killer. He will be shot on sight.</i><br><br>The highest-ranking officers have made their decision.<br>If they deem a thing innocent, so be it.<br>If they deem a thing evil, then so be it.<br>They need no reasoning; they are soldiers. <br><br>But I still refuse to believe the boy is a murderer.<br><br>"You trust him? You're just being selfish." <br><br>Though I am alone, I think I hear a man's voice beside me.<br>Where is it coming from? <br><br>As I look around my small apartment, my eyes lock with the<br>man in the mirror on the wall. Though he has same face as<br>myself, he wears a lopsided smile as he begins to whisper.<br><br>"He ignored your orders and ran off on his own. Had you not<br>gone out of your way to save him, your blue-eyed subordinate<br>would still be alive. Saving him was a mistake. Your actions<br>bring only death to your fellows. You haven't changed a bit—<br>it's the same as when you your selfish actions got all your<br>squadmates killed. Oh, you might be able to fool everyone<br>else, but you'll never be able to fool <i>me</i>." <br><br>I turn my gun to the man in the mirror.<br>But just as I am about to pull the trigger...<br><br>"Captain, can you hear me? I have news." <br><br>I hear the quiet voice of one of my men from the other side<br>of the door and I feel the mist clouding my mind vanish.<br>The man in the mirror is gone. All I see is Captain Craven<br>with his finger on the trigger.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Invisible Bullet (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">There'd been a murder at base, and the victim and young<br>soldier thought to be the culprit were both part of my unit.<br>The military police decided the boy was guilty and placed<br>him on the wanted list without even holding a trial.<br>They also issued an order to kill him on sight.<br><br>Eventually, I got word the boy was hiding in a foreign city<br>on the border. This information came from a few of my<br>subordinates, good men who snuck it to me while I was still<br>locked away on house arrest. <br><br>And that's how I now find myself on the outskirts of that<br>foreign city. I'm not supposed to be here—I'm not even<br>supposed to have left the base. But the same subordinates<br>who got me the information agreed to distract any curious<br>superior officers and guards. Still, they can only keep<br>their attention for so long. I have to find the boy,<br>and quickly. More importantly, I need to hear the truth<br>from his own mouth, and in his own words.<br><br>The truth that he is innocent.<br><br>                             *          *          *<br><br>The border city sprawls beyond the field of sunflowers that<br>grows over the old train tracks. The military has long been<br>waiting for an opportunity to capture this place, and I've<br>heard rumblings it may be the next target on our list.<br><br>Still, this is not a city easily cowed—they're used to<br>living under siege, and the self-defense force that protects<br>it allows citizens to live lives of happiness and ease.<br><br>I enter the city under the guise of being a common traveler.<br>Then I begin my search for the boy, venturing along the<br>main street in search of clues. Eventually, I feel eyes on<br>my back, and turn to see a group of children staring up at<br>me curiously.  It seems travelers are something of a rare<br>breed here. Still, these moppets likely have the run of<br>the place, so I ask them to show me around. <br><br>"C'mon, mister!" they say brightly. "You gotta see this!" <br><br>With proud little smiles, they bring me to the foot of a<br>high hill, upon which stands an observation platform that<br>contains a large cannon.<br><br>"Watch! It's really cool!" <br><br>A moment later, the world is shattered by an enormous <i>boom</i>.<br>Yet what comes out of the cannon is not artillery, but a<br>large ball of water. As I watch it soar across the sky,<br>the children explain how their people use the cannon to<br>water the sunflowers growing on the old tracks. <br><br>I find the entire endeavor to be remarkable. But when I<br>turn my gaze back to the platform, I see a svelte boy<br>standing beside the cannon. Though the sun silhouettes him<br>against the sky, I cannot mistake the form of a subordinate<br>with whom I've already shared so much joy and pain. <br><br>It is the boy. The deserter. The accused.<br><br><i>Boom</i> and a globule of water flies through the air. <br><i>Boom</i> and another. <i>Boom.</i> <i>Boom.</i> <i>Boom.</i><br><br>Each one is accompanied by the cheers of happy children,<br>but I can't hear any of it over the beating of my own heart. <br><br>                             *          *          *<br><br>Sunflowers bloom proudly along the old tracks. According to<br>the children, the boy passes this place every day on his way<br>to do his shopping. Knowing this, I sit down to wait.<br><br>I sit for hours, barely moving, alone with my thoughts.<br>Just as the sun began to set, he finally appears. When he<br>notices me, his eyes widen slightly and he comes to a halt. <br><br>"Why are you...?" he begins. He's clearly shocked,<br>so I spare him any further abuse and get right to it.<br><br>"You didn't kill him. Did you?" <br><br>All he has to do is shake his head and it will all be over.<br>Yet for some reason, he doesn't.<br><br>"I can clear this entire thing up," I continue. "Just come<br>back with me and—"<br><br>Before I can say more, he draws the blade hanging at his<br>hip and points it at me.<br><br>"No. I killed him. That's why I came here." <br><br>Though the tip of the blade presses ever closer to my<br>throat, I don't move an inch. He wouldn't kill one of<br>his own. He wouldn't. He <i>couldn't</i>.<br><br>Finally, the boy sighs, sheathes his blade, and walks past<br>me with quick steps. "Just leave me alone," he says before<br>vanishing to somewhere further down the road.<br><br>It's hot. The sun burns the nape of my neck as my head<br>hangs low. I stare at my feet—at a puddle created by the<br>cannon on the old tracks. The man I see there—a man with<br>the same face as me—begins to cackle. <br><br>"Didn't I say this would happen? This is all your fault!<br>You saved him, and now someone with a bright future is—"<br><br>I stamp my foot into the puddle and shut the man up.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Reflections of A Fool (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">There was a murder in the squadron. The prime suspect was <br>the boy who was known for being a problem, but I knew he<br>would never do such a thing.<br><br>Or at least, I thought I knew.<br><br>Because when I broke probation and went to the border city<br>where he was hiding, he admitted to being the killer.<br><br>                          *          *          *<br><br>"Captain. Are you there?" <br><br>The voice is followed by a knock at the door. It's my<br>subordinate, the same one who helped me slip away<br>while I was on probation.<br><br>I'd returned to the barracks two weeks ago, and he'd<br>checked on me every day since. I know he wants to hear<br>what happened in the city, but I can't tell him.<br><br>I can't tell <i>anyone</i>.<br><br>Because my men would never forgive me.<br><br><i>If you didn't go out of your way to save his life, there would<br>have been no murder. Everything you do leads us into<br>the jaws of death. All you know how to do is sin.</i><br><br>When I come to, I'm crouched in the corner of my room<br>waiting for it all to be over.<br><br><i>Aw, look how upset you are! Keep that up, and your<br>soldiers will never take you seriously again.</i><br><br>That voice again. Shaking it off, I stand and plant<br>myself in front of the mirror, looking back at the man<br>who shares my face.<br><br><i>I know how you can escape this darkness,</i> he says.<br><br>I reach out and brush my fingertips against the glass.<br>"Tell me."<br><br>The man in the mirror smiles kindly. <i>It's easy. Kill the<br>criminal and atone. That's the only way to save your soul—<br>and the soul of your dead subordinate.</i><br><br>"I have to...kill him?" <br><br><i>Yes. Kill him. Just like you killed me.</i><br><br>As I gaze into the darkened eyes of the man in the mirror,<br>I think back. My selfishness once cost the lives of many of<br>my compatriots. So once I became a captain, I strove to<br>always be thoughtful and attentive so I wouldn't make the<br>same mistake twice. <br><br>I killed the true me—the arrogant face in the mirror.<br>It was the all I could think to do to absolve myself.<br><br><i>Kill him with your own hands.</i><br><br>I must...kill him.<br><br>I must <i>kill</i> him. It's the only way to atone.<br><br>So that night, I slip out once more, seeking to avenge one<br>of my soldiers and absolve myself of sin for good and all.<br><br>                          *          *          *<br><br>I walk for hours before finally coming to a familiar set<br>of train tracks. As midnight comes and goes, I see distant<br>flames dancing in the summertime sky.<br><br>The fires of battle rage in the border city.<br><br>As I pass retreating soldiers, understanding finally dawns.<br>Our army has finally launched an attack on this city.<br>They did so while I was on probation. <br><br>As the sunflowers along the tracks crackle and burn,<br>a small moth descends and vanishes into the flame.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Midnight Star (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">The young boy from my squad confessed to murdering one<br>of his fellow soldiers. If I hadn't gone out of my way to save<br>the boy on our previous mission, the other man would still<br>be alive. This is all my fault. <br><br>I make for the border city where he's hiding so I can kill<br>him and absolve myself of this sin. But when I arrive,<br>the city is nothing but a burning husk. The army had long<br>been plotting to advance on the city, and this was the<br>night they finally put their plan into motion.<br><br>I walk and walk and walk, but all I see are bodies. Bodies.<br><i>Bodies.</i> There isn't a single survivor to be found.<br><br>As the smell of burning flesh fills my nostrils, the stench<br>makes flashes of a hell I once witnessed play in my mind.<br>A time when I had just joined the army—and when my own<br>selfishness caused my entire squad to perish. <br><br>I shake my head, erasing the sight. There's no time to be<br>thinking of the past. I have to find the boy, kill him,<br>and finally atone. <br><br><i>But look at this place. Nothing could have survived.<br>If the boy was here, he's already dead.</i><br><br>As that thought crosses my mind, a sound comes from the<br>burnt building beside me. If memory serves, it was once the<br>HQ of the city's self-defense force—the organization that<br>tried so desperately to bring life to the town. <br><br>The fire has died down, so I slip through the entrance,<br>hold my breath, and make my way down the hall as I follow<br>a trail of blood.<br><br><i>This will be a fine resting place for you.</i><br><br>I find the boy in a room at the end of the hall. He's on<br>the floor, holding the bloody corpse of a woman in his arms.<br>Next to her is a single burned sunflower.<br><br>The blood in the hallway must have belonged to the woman.<br>It seems impossible for the small-framed boy to have carried<br>her all this way, but he must have done so. Whoever she is,<br>she looks almost exactly like him. But none of that matters<br>now, because my only objective is to finish this. <br><br>I stand in the doorway and aim my gun, ready to finally<br>absolve myself of my sins. But as my finger slips to the<br>trigger, he looks up at me with a tear-stained face that<br>causes me to take a step backwards. <br><br>In that instant, it all comes flooding back. Memories of<br>the time when I'd just joined the army. When I pushed my<br>squad to annihilation because of my selfishness. And the<br>absolute hell I'd existed in ever since.<br><br><i>Captain, I...</i> <br><br>I'd sobbed over my captain's body, repeating those two words<br>over and over. As I cursed my foolishness, I told myself I<br>would never make the same mistake again. I would never lose<br>another ally the way I lost him.<br><br>"Shoot him!" cries a sudden voice. I look up and see the<br>man with my face shouting at me from a reflection in the<br>window. "Shoot him! Erase your sins! That's why you're here,<br>isn't it!?" <br><br>Yes. That's why I'm here. I can only atone by killing him. <br><br>Had I not saved him in battle, he would have never killed<br>the other man. It's my fault I lost another of my allies,<br>and I have to fix my mistake.<br><br>But the boy with the corpse in his arms and tears<br>streaming down his face... <br><br>He looks <i>so much</i> like me. <br><br>"<i>Shoot!</i>" cries the man in the window again. And this<br>time, I obey. I pull the trigger. The bullet flies, shattering the<br>window where the face had been a moment before.<br><br>I lower my weapon and rush to the boy, who drops his gaze<br>and begins to mutter in a voice thick with tears.<br><br>"Thought...I told you to stay away from me..." <br><br>"Yeah. You did. But..." I pause, unable to figure out what<br>comes next. But at last, I say:<br><br>"I'm glad you survived." <br><br>That's all.<br><br>The boy admitted to killing his squadmate. Yet. <i>And yet.</i><br>He is still one of my own, a comrade-in-arms with whom<br>I've survived battles and hardships.<br><br>And I cannot be happy with his death.<br><br>Now that he sits before me, I finally realize I'd taken up<br>a gun to right my own mistakes. I was going to kill for the<br>sake of a dead comrade. <br><br>That's not atoning. It's ego. Selfishness. <br><br>I'm not interested in saving my companions. Oh no.<br>I just want to be forgiven.<br><br>"Everyone wants to hear your side of the story," I say.<br>"Come home. Tell the truth." But he just shakes his head. <br><br>"There are some things I can't say," he says in a voice<br>colored by agony. And when he looks at me again,<br>I can't bring myself to force the truth from him. <br><br>                         ＊          ＊          ＊<br><br>A month has passed since we parted ways at the border city. <br><br>I'm currently rifling through files in the storage room<br>where the incident occurred. I want to know the truth the<br>boy was hiding, but I'm coming up empty. No surprise there—<br>any files have likely been intentionally destroyed. Hell,<br>even the fact the boy was once part of my squad is now<br>nothing but a distant rumor.<br><br>When I think about it rationally, it's all been so strange.<br>A murder happened between two people with a boring, normal<br>relationship, and the military ordered the perpetrator shot<br>on sight without even holding a trial.<br><br>Light leaks in through the crack in the reference room door.<br>I stare at it, recalling how distressed the boy had looked.<br>He was a criminal who killed one of his own, which is a<br>fact I've grown to accept. But <i>why</i> did he do it?<br>What was the reason?<br><br>I wish I could have brought some light to the dark truth<br>that weighed on him. I wish I could have helped him.<br>That's also the job of a captain, and I failed.<br><br>If I ever get the chance to see him again, I'm going to<br>learn the truth. Nothing will stop me this time—no matter<br>how many orders I have to break.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: The Soldier's Crimes (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">Hello. Mama here. I read over<br>the report you made on the<br>captain. Though it was quite<br>well-written, I feel you are<br>avoiding certain things by<br>using unclear language.<br> <br>Let's take a look at this<br>part, for example: <i>Though they<br>called him Captain Craven<br>behind his back, he was a<br>calm and gentle soul. But his<br>skills as a soldier kept his<br>hot-headed squad together,<br>and everyone recognized that.</i><br><br>Now, you're right that his<br>squadron felt like a family<br>because of his kindly nature.<br>But you <i>also</i> know what<br>happened back then, right?<br>Don't shy away from what the<br>man is like on the inside.<br>Remember what he's done to<br>protect his men, and how guilt<br>weighs him down as he fights.<br><br>These things are important for<br>you to write down, because I'm<br>certain it will prove a bit of<br>salvation for him as well.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: A Letter to a Boy Soldier (No.06)</p>
<p class="para">Hey there. How you holding up?<br><br>Just kidding. I already know<br>you get all mopey whenever we<br>put you in the discipline room,<br>but I really want you to think<br>about what you did this time.<br>I understand wanting to sneak<br>a little extra food when you're<br>on mess-hall duty—I really do.<br>But getting scolded for it<br>doesn't give you a free pass to<br>knock out one of your fellows.<br>You need to work on solving<br>problems like that with words<br>instead of fists, and that's<br>something I'm going to help<br>you with in the future.<br><br>Oh, and while we're at it,<br>please be a little more<br>thorough when you're on<br>laundry duty. You don't want<br>the enemy to smell us coming<br>from a mile away, right?<br>And yes, I know this letter is<br>veering into nagging territory,<br>but I really need you to be<br>more considerate of your squad.<br>If you treated them even half as<br>good as you treat the horses...<br><br>You know what? I'm not even<br>Going to finish that sentence,<br>Because you'll just get mad.<br>But that said, the horses are<br>always in a great mood whenever<br>you work the stables, and I<br>appreciate how you always treat<br>them with so much love and care.<br><br>Anyway, look forward to having<br>you back in the squad soon.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 7: Promotion Proposal (No.07)</p>
<p class="para">The tide of battle turned<br>greatly in our favor with this<br>recent operation. The brave<br>judgment of one particular<br>soldier brought this about,<br>and his achievements in our<br>most recent operation are<br>beyond reproach.<br> <br>It is for this reason that we<br>propose his promotion to the<br>rank of Captain.<br><br>I am aware that his temper was<br>was a topic in a recent<br>meeting, but this likely stems<br>from discord with his activist<br>father —and is also not that<br>unusual with young people<br>today. Furthermore, I hear he<br>has been calmer since losing<br>his squad in a recent mission,<br>so perhaps that experience has<br>served as a catalyst for self-<br>improvement. However, even if<br>this change of heart does not<br>stick, command is well aware<br>that soldiers with his<br>personality type are very good<br>at controlling subordinates,<br>which makes the subject of<br>his temperament ultimately<br>inconsequential. <br><br>It is our opinion that his<br>particular blend of combat<br>prowess and tactical aptitude,<br>coupled with his personality,<br>will help him rise through the<br>ranks quickly, and that he<br>may, in fact, lead our entire<br>force one day.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 8: Fifty Years Post-War (No.08)</p>
<p class="para">Retired Soldier A: That battle<br>was hell. I could hear my<br>fellow soldiers screaming for<br>help all around me, and with<br>each shriek, I told myself<br>they were going to be fine.<br>I had to, you understand?<br>Otherwise, I'd never be able<br>to get them out of my mind,<br>which would have been the<br>end of me.<br><br>Anyway, that's when I saw the<br>enemy captain pointing his<br>gun at a soldier begging for<br>his life. His eyes were the<br>devil's, cold and heartless<br>as an ice storm. I don't think<br>that man had a drop of human<br>blood in him; hell, he was the<br>same one who sculpted the<br>mountains of corpses and<br>unleashed the rivers of blood.<br>And sure, I survived, but I<br>still remember the fear.<br>The fear never went away.<br><br>I hear that devil is still<br>hailed as a hero in his<br>homeland. I suppose war<br>grants boons like that to<br>creatures such as him.<br><br><i>That sounds like a terrifying<br>experience. May I ask,<br>have you been struck by any<br>particular feelings in the<br>half-century since the war<br>came to an end?</i><br><br>Retired Soldier A: Fifty years<br>already? My god...<br><br>Well, that war may be over,<br>but I doubt mine will ever<br>end. Not unless I find a way<br>to forget the look in that<br>devil's eyes...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 10: A Letter from a Hero (No.10)</p>
<p class="para">I gathered all the information I could find on the secret<br>operation and wrote it down in a single document—one<br>I'm now planning to release to the public.<br><br>It's wrong for a soldier to do such a thing, and I will<br>doubtless be named a traitor to my homeland if I go<br>through with it. But at this point, I'm used to committing<br>sins. I've completed missions as ordered, and killed more<br>people than those orders even required. My sins are legion,<br>because I firmly believed that by killing, the dead men<br>in my squad would forgive my selfishness.<br><br>But if I'm going to keep doing wrong, I should finally<br>commit a wrong on the right side of justice.<br><br>I've steeled myself for being ridiculed over my definition<br>of justice, but in the end, it doesn't matter. I've made<br>up my mind. The world will know of this inhuman operation<br>that has brought so much pain to my men.<br><br>And they will know it because of me.</p>
