<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A perfectly ordered military procession marches forth, boots pounding in synch on the<br>hardscrabble ground. Troops kick up dirt in the training range as they run through an endless<br>series of drills. If a person joins the military, they are essentially offering up their life to a country.<br>For when the time comes, they will be thrown into battle without hesitation or mercy. Yet in this<br>poor country, there is no end to the number of candidates eagerly waiting to enlist. This is<br>because the monetary bonus for joining is substantial. Thousands upon thousands apply to join<br>every year, each one drawn by the well-known catchphrase: "Join in a day, eat for a lifetime!"<br>But with so many applicants, the army can afford to be picky—<br>and most would-be recruits end up washing out. Those who are successful are assigned to one<br>of several squads, where they serve under a captain, as well as senior squadmates who function<br>as instructors. Squads eat together, sleep together, and train together. The idea is to teach<br>discipline through group activities.<br><br>This is a small base stationed at the border of the country. The new recruits stand in a<br>row in the briefing room. At the front of the room, the captain calls the name of a recruit who<br>achieved top scores in the military exam. In response, a young man steps forward and snaps<br>off a dignified salute. The captain expresses his high hopes for the young recruit, who barks<br>out a loud "Sir, yes, sir!" in reply. Everyone present can feel the ambition burning inside him.<br><br>A few nights later, loud voices ring out in the dorm. The young man has started an<br>argument with a fellow squad member. The two had been in competition with each other since<br>the day they arrived, and often butted heads. Yet while the young man had a reputation for<br>arrogance and was generally avoided by his fellow soldiers, he managed to form a sort of<br>relationship with the other man despite their rivalry. He was his friend—perhaps his <i>only</i> friend.<br>As their argument heats up, the other soldiers gather around and egg them on, clearly enjoying<br>the show.<br><br>"You're always so goddamn selfish!" cries the friend.<br>He is angry—almost quaking with rage—<br>yet the young man is equally furious.<br>"Yeah, well, I actually have things I want to ACHIEVE!"<br><br>The argument quickly turns violent, forcing the other soldiers to intervene—but they have<br>trouble pulling the two apart. The fight ends as suddenly as it began when a door opens. The<br>moment the squad catches sight of their captain, they grow silent and fall in at perfect attention.<br>The captain just mutters and shakes his head at the pair before ordering them to clean the storage<br>room as punishment. The senior who was responsible for instructing the pair is also ordered to<br>pitch in, and his irritation is clear.<br><br>When they reach the storage room, they find it in a state of extreme disarray.<br><br>"Can't believe the damn captain is making me do this," grumbles the young man.<br>"I mean, this is grunt work! What's even the point!?"<br>"Move your hands, not your mouth," responds the instructor.<br>"Accepting punishment is part of being a soldier."<br><br>The silence of his fellow squadmates as they clean only spurs the young man's irritation further.<br>"This is stupid. I have things I have to accomplish. I need to fight! I need to win a medal of honor!"<br>A medal of honor. It is the highest honor awarded by their country, given only to soldiers who<br>accomplish greatness. Those who receive it are said to be destined for success.<br><br>"I'm going to be the best," continues the young man, "and everyone else is going to know it!"<br>Though many members of the army enlist for the cash bonus, the young man joined only to fulfill<br>the ambition in his heart. But this is the first time he's ever told his squadmates about his true<br>goals. He has skill to spare in the military arts, so it's clearly not some flash-in-the-pan ideal.<br>The relief he feels at finally expressing it is palpable. His speech made, the young man makes<br>to leave the storage room. When his friend reminds him their work has only begun, he keeps<br>walking and says: "My part's done. I'm going to sleep." Ambitious goals cannot be achieved alone.<br>It takes the work of those who walk beside us. This is clearly a lesson the young man has yet<br>to learn. The remaining two soldiers in the storage room smile wryly at each other, each of them<br>silently mulling over this very thought.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Several days later... The squad is called together for a strategy meeting. As they gather<br>in the briefing room, tension fills the air. The silence is perfect. But after ten long minutes, the<br>briefing has yet to begin. It seems the captain has slept in. <i>Again.</i> This realization spurs the young<br>man's frustration anew.<br><br>Finally, the captain arrives in a disheveled state.<br>"Sorry about that," he says to muted laughter.<br>"Guess I missed the alarm again."<br><br>This said, he turns serious, as does the rest of the room.<br><br>"Here's the latest: We've detected enemy forces marching en masse toward the border."<br>Any remaining smiles in the room vanish at this news. The captain begins explaining their mission.<br>"We are to stop the enemy's advance and protect our nation's territory. And as luck would have it,<br>this base is directly in their path."<br>"Our <i>only</i> objective is to protect this base. We just need the enemy to withdraw while keeping our<br>losses to a minimum."<br><br>The briefing room fills with murmurs at this news. Reactions run the gamut from<br>enthusiasm to relief to unease. But the young man leaps to his feet and asks permission to speak.<br>Stifling a tired yawn, the captain tells him to continue. The sneer on the young man's face is<br>clear to all. After some initial comments on the state of the enemy, he voices disagreement with<br>the plan, and suggests a total annihilation of their forces instead. A nervous buzz ripples through<br>the room. But the young man ignores it and continues pressing his case.<br><br>"These people have threatened our borders for far too long! If we take out one of their squadrons,<br>we'll be heroes! People will have to—"<br>"That's enough, soldier," says the captain softly.<br>"Remember what I said? The most important part of this plan is defending the base and keeping<br>casualties to a bare minimum. Because if any of the men here die, that falls on me."<br><br>Rather than backing down, the young man redoubles his efforts and engages in verbal sparring<br>with the captain for some time.<br><br>In the end, however, he is overruled and the briefing ends. His plan rejected, the young<br>man is infuriated.<br><br>"Why the hell doesn't he get it!? I'm thinking of this squad far more than he is!"<br>Still convinced his plan is correct, he makes the rounds of his fellow soldiers, looking for any<br>who might agree with him. With the arrogant attitude he has always displayed to his fellows, he<br>does not find many who will side with him. Even the man he thinks of as his best friend turns<br>him down. It's not that he doesn't desire glory; everyone in the squad wants nothing more than<br>to wear a medal of honor. But he joined the military to keep his head down, follow orders, and<br>send money home to his family. So he can't risk everything on his friend's reckless plan. Were<br>these reasons true? Perhaps. Or perhaps he is simply irritated the young man is crafting<br>alternative plans on his own without even consulting anyone. The young man realizes his friend<br>has balled his hand into a fist. With the thoughts and emotions of the pair still at odds, the day<br>of the operation grows ever closer...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The battlefield is silent; it's almost impossible to believe a war ever raged here. All the<br>young man can hear is his own ragged breath. He stands in the borders of the base; scattered<br>before him are countless numbers of corpses. There is no doubt who they are.<br><br>Four hours earlier... The enemy arrives at the base, and the battle begins. The squad<br>digs in and defends the base from the enemy, just as the captain ordered. But the young man,<br>impatient with this war of attrition, decides to commence with his own plan. Taking advantage<br>of the terrain surrounding the base, he launches a surprise attack that takes out half the enemy<br>in a single swoop. He is joined by a handful of soldiers who see things his way—<br>and though many of them fall in battle, their bold tactics force the enemy to initiate a full retreat.<br>As he watches his foes scatter, the young man grins.<br><br>"I was right," he whispers.<br>"I was <i>right</i>."<br><br>Though his squad had not accomplished much in battle until now, they are sure to earn praise<br>for this great victory. He is one step closer to his medal of honor.<br><br>With those thoughts in his mind, he returns to the base—<br>but the sight waiting for him there is a hellscape. His squadmates—all of them—lie dead or<br>dying on the ground. Dumbfounded, he wanders among their bodies, the smell of burnt flesh<br>and blood and gunpowder stinging his nostrils. It is the most horrific sight the young man has<br>ever seen. He forces his breathing to slow and resists the urge to vomit.<br><br>"It's okay," he tells himself.<br>"It's okay."<br><br>And though his legs feel heavy and false, he forces them to carry him forward. But then his foot<br>catches on something and he tumbles to the ground. At his feet is one of his squad members,<br>heavily injured and covered in dirt and debris from an explosion. It is his instructor. Though he<br>still breathes, it is with great difficulty, as he is bleeding from multiple wounds.<br><br>"Hey! Wake up!"<br>Realizing the young man is speaking to him, the instructor manages to open a single eye. It roves<br>about blindly for a moment before finally settling on the figure of the young man.<br><br>"You...attacked the enemy..."<br>"Knew you would..."<br>"The captain...tried to save you..."<br>"He changed...our formation... and now look at us..."<br><br>With that, the instructor draws one last, hitching breath before falling silent forever.<br><i>The captain did this for me?</i> thinks the young man. <i>But I always caused him so much trouble...</i><br>Unable to accept his instructor's death, the young man wanders the battlefield in a haze,<br>searching for his captain.<br><br>Instead, he finds what remains of his only friend. An explosion has blasted off most of<br>his left leg, leaving a pool of blood at the base of the stump.<br>"Good to see you're in one piece..." says his friend.<br><br>The fact he is still able to make jokes in such a condition is remarkable. The young man begins<br>stammering out an apology.<br><br>"I'm... I'm sorry. I just wanted..."<br>"I know," whispers his friend.<br>"I wanted one too..."<br>"Said this was for my family...but that medal sure would have been nice..."<br><br>With that, he speaks no more. Tears begin to run from the young man's eyes as he sets off<br>again in search of his captain. He sees bodies. Bodies. <i>Bodies.</i> Each one bearing a familiar face.<br><br>Finally, he sees the captain and runs to his side. He calls out to him again and again,<br>but the man makes no response.<br><br>"Sir, I... I didn't mean..."<br>He grasps the captain's ravaged hand. He wants the captain to reprimand him. He <i>needs</i> it.<br>Otherwise, his apology would be meaningless. There is so much to say: He'd made a horrible<br>mistake. He'd been wrong where the captain had been right. But he can scarcely force two<br>words together. And the tears that pour down his face only make things harder. But then the<br>young man realizes something:<br>The captain is squeezing his hand in return. <i>He's still breathing. He's ALIVE!</i><br><br>"Ah," says the captain weakly.<br>"I'm glad you survived..."<br><br>The captain's eyes are closed; his senses all but gone. There is no way he can know whose<br>hand he grasps. And yet somehow, he seems to recognize the young man, and ends his life<br>with a faint smile on his face. With that, the operation is over. The young man is the only survivor.<br></p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">Though it came at the cost of everything, the young man is finally a hero. For despite<br>the sacrifices required, the enemy had withdrawn. The young man is given time off to recuperate.<br>Which is how he finds himself with nothing to do. Or perhaps it is more apt to say there is<br>nothing he <i>can</i> do. Day after day, he hides in his house and attempts to drown his sorrows with<br>strong drink. Empty bottles lie scattered across his floor. Rats run to and fro amidst the refuse<br>and spoil. He wakes up, grabs a bottle, and drinks until he passes out. When he come to, he<br>begins the process all over again. If that was his entire life, it might be all right. But he sees<br>flashbacks to the battle in his sleep, and these nightmares torture him.<br><br>The battleground...<br>The faces of enemies he killed...<br>His squadmates dying before his eyes...<br><br>His instructor. His best friend. The captain. All of them die in his arms.<br><br>Day after day<br><br>after day after day after day<br><br>after day after day after day after day<br>after day after day after day after day<br><br>The nightmares play on repeat, bringing his life to a halt.<br><br><i>If only I hadn't made that suggestion...</i><br><i>If only I hadn't ignored my orders...</i><br><i>If only... If only... If only...</i><br><br>His world becomes an endless spiral of regret.<br><br><i>Was there even a point to what I did?</i><br><i>Do I feel pride in what I did?</i><br><i>Was there justice to what I did?</i><br><i>Is this all because of my selfishness? Because of a goddamn medal?</i><br><i>Maybe I should just end it all.</i><br><br>He drunkenly loads bullets into his gun, raises the muzzle to his temple, and stands.<br>He places his finger on the trigger, closes his eyes, and breaths in a lungful of stale air.<br><br>"Hold on, everyone... I'm coming."<br>He moves to pull the trigger. But he is drunker than he imagines, and with his eyes closed,<br>his balance flees and sends him crashing into a nearby table.<br><br>When he opens his eyes, he sees a familiar envelope. It is the kind used for notices by<br>the military's highest-ranking officials. Inside is an official letter congratulating him on<br>annihilating the enemy, and announcing that he will be rewarded with a medal of honor and<br>promotion to captain.<br><br>"Ridiculous..." mutters the young man.<br>"Goddamn ridiculous..."<br>"I'm only alive because the rest of them saved me."<br><br>Seeing the letter again reminds him that the ceremony is tomorrow. Finally, he takes a handful<br>of sleeping pills and falls into bed.<br><br>He dreams. It is the same dream as ever—a dream of that day. But this time, it does<br>not begin after the battle. Instead, it begins before he set off to face the enemy on his own.<br><i>No. I won't make the same mistake again.</i> This time, he does not initiate his plan. Instead,<br>he remains at the base and kills every last enemy soldier he sees, swearing he will make sure<br>they never kill again. He slays as if in the grip of madness. Enemy soldiers fall—so many he<br>cannot count their number. But it doesn't matter; he will do anything to save his brothers.<br>Suddenly, he looks out and sees the faces of the people he has been slaughtering: They are<br>all part of his squad. His instructor. His friend. His captain. He killed them with his own hands<br>once more. With a short cry, the young man finally understands:<br>"I'll never be able to save them, no matter what I do."<br><br>The sickening dream wakes him up. The morning sun streams in through the window.<br>It is the day of the medal ceremony—the day of what he <i>thought</i> was his dearest wish. What<br>meaning can there be in someone who wiped out his own squad accepting a medal? How can<br>he face their memory? And when the ceremony is over, he will be a captain. A leader with<br>troops of his own.<br><br>"What do I do, Captain? How do I atone for my sins?"<br>He asks himself this as he puts on his formal dress uniform. As he stares at himself in the<br>mirror for the first time in a very long while, he sees how emaciated he has become. With<br>heavy steps, he turns his back on the ghost in the glass and makes his way to the ceremonial venue. <br><br>Almost as though it is his redemption...</p>
