<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A desolate landscape stretches in all directions.<br>The poppies that covered the field only a few days ago were all burnt to ash,<br>and the butterflies that extolled the beauty of spring are now dead.<br>The flowers are dead. The butterflies are dead.<br>The only survivors are soldiers and rats, but they, too, are slowly dying.<br>The young man's squad is completely surrounded.<br>Neither retreat nor surrender are permissible in this situation.<br>This prolonged war has exhausted the army.<br>They knew from the start that the enemy had the overwhelming advantage<br>in terms of resources.<br>Despite it all, the man has maintained battle lines,<br>but it seems he's reached a limit from which there is no escape.<br>Artillery bursts in the air. The nighttime battlefield is awash in light.<br>Gouges dot the earth. Mud, guns and swords, blood and bones,<br>and screaming soldiers...<br>The battlefield exists between the boundaries of life and death.<br>Bullets whiz overhead. The young man hides behind a barricade<br>as he takes aim at his enemy, his finger resting on the trigger, focusing.<br>How can he overcome the disparity in resources and win this fight?<br>Ultimately, as captain, how can he protect his squad?<br>But the nightmares that constantly replay in his mind hinder his thinking.<br>They are memories of when he first joined the army.<br>His own selfish actions in battle led to the death of his entire squad.<br>He recalls walking among the bodies of his compatriots, crying.<br>He recalls the smell of burning flesh, the sensation of entrails sticking<br>to his soles.<br>To this day, he thinks of that hell every time he loses a soldier.<br>At this rate, isn't everyone's death inevitable? Just like it was back then?<br>The worst-case scenario plays in his mind. He shakes his head.<br>He cannot let the past drag him down, not right now.<br>He digs his nails into his temples. The pain forces the guilt and fear<br>to leave his body.<br>He <i>must</i> do this. Otherwise, he very well may lose his mind.<br>The battle grows ever more intense, and still, he cannot find an effective<br>way forward.<br>It's then that a man wearing an eyepatch appears before him.<br>The man with the eyepatch grins widely and<br>points his gun at the young man's chest.<br>But before the young man can react,<br>the other man has already pulled the trigger.<br>A red flower blooms.<br>A red flower made of cloth bursts from the gun's barrel.<br>The young man's eyes go wide.<br>The eyepatch man gives a light chuckle.<br>You look like hell. Ain't every day I see you like that.<br>The young man heaves a sigh of both exasperation and relief.<br>The easygoing eyepatch man is an ally in the same army.<br>Much like the young man, he commands his own squad.<br>That he's here means he's finally met with the reinforcements.<br>Don't you worry. Now that we're together, we'll make it outta here alive.<br>The young man nods at his encouraging words.<br>And to himself, he makes a vow.<br>He will not allow his compatriots to die. Not like last time.<br>The eyepatch man commands his squad to move to the front.<br>Timing a precise opportunity for them, he orders a hail of gunfire.<br>Like a magic trick, smoke and flame bloom to hide him and his allies.<br>The young man takes advantage of the situation to command his own squad<br>to press forward and eliminate the enemy.<br>Despite the strife of the battlefield, the eyepatch man remains calm<br>and easygoing.<br>Though his countenance is more akin to a court jester than a soldier,<br>the young man trusts him all the same.<br>He boldly cuts his way into the enemy camp, but his eye focuses<br>more on his own squad than on his enemies.<br>He rallies the frightened soldiers, keeping tabs on the situation and avoiding<br>any unnecessarily harsh orders. Now and then,<br>he volunteers to venture into danger personally.<br>No matter how brutal the battle, he never forgets the care he holds<br>for his soldiers. In that regard, he's quite similar to the young man.<br>The two captains press forward with squads in tow.<br>But the enemy has an overwhelming material advantage.<br>Days pass, and enemy reinforcements arrive.<br>They attack from behind, attempting to occupy the rear.<br>One can scarcely hear over the raging battle's deafening crescendo.<br>Their lines of communication fall, and the squad descends into chaos.<br>Still, the young man and his soldiers fight back in the face of certain death.<br>They shoot, stab, and pummel every enemy that comes into view.<br>Stopping is not an option.<br>They must get through this and send everyone home alive.<br>They must reorganize their strategy, no matter what it takes.<br>Night approaches. A flare overhead shines like a firework.<br>In the red light that bathes the field,<br>the young man spots an artillery shell headed directly for them.<br>The nightmares of battle, the fear of killing enemies,<br>the guilt of dying allies—it all heralds the end.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Red sky. Bloody footprints. A hellish battlefield.<br>The young man huddles on the ground, arms covering his head,<br>his dead compatriots standing around him.<br>It's the recurring nightmare that slowly consumes him.<br>Some of the dead are squadmates who perished due to his selfish actions<br>long ago. Others are soldiers who die due to his powerless now.<br>With glares of hatred, they point their guns at him.<br><i>This is your fault.</i><br><i>We'd have been better off without you.</i><br>They batter him with curses, and in unison, they pull their triggers.<br>......<br>.........<br>............<br>Along with the bullets that riddle his body in the dream comes<br>a sweet sensation...and then he awakens.<br>The peculiar ecstasy mixes with the discomfort of his soaked clothes.<br>Why this dream? Why now?<br>He suppresses his urge to vomit as he sits up in his hard bed.<br>It's barely dawn. The room is dim.<br>He can hear the pitter-patter of rats scurrying about the room.<br>He looks around.<br>The enemy's detention house is dark.<br>He and his soldiers are prisoners—they sleep on a row of beds, a dozen or so.<br>The young man sits atop the bed in a corner.<br>A few days prior,<br>he and his squad found themselves between a rock and a hard place.<br>The eyepatch man and his squad arrived as reinforcements.<br>Together, their strategy afforded them a brief advantage.<br>But once enemy reinforcements arrived, the battle became a deadlock.<br>As the carnage grew, the chain of command began to collapse.<br>Amidst the concentrated fire, the young man lost consciousness.<br>In spite of the looming death, his wounds were not serious.<br>And in spite of everything, when he awoke,<br>he found himself a prisoner in this detention camp.<br>That must've been one hell of a dream.<br>There came a voice from the bed beside him.<br>The eyepatch man smiles as he regards the young man.<br>He and several of his own soldiers have been captured as well.<br>But the young man does not know what transpired<br>on the battlefield nor the status of his soldiers.<br>And, of course, there's no guarantee anyone will leave this terrible place alive.<br>The thought of his fellows dying sends a shiver down the young man's spine.<br>He digs his nails into his skin—the sensation of pain may be the only thing<br>that allows him to maintain his sanity.<br>But the eyepatch man grasps the young man by the arm to stop him.<br>He sits beside him and peers into his face.<br>C'mon, buddy. I'm asking you what's the matter.<br>His voice inspired his soldiers countless times in that catastrophic battle.<br>Hearing it for himself, the young man feels a bit calmer.<br>In my dream, my soldiers killed me.<br>He reveals his past, his nightmares.<br>His voice is hoarse, and quiet so he doesn't wake the other soldiers.<br>Quiet so only the eyepatch man hears him.<br>Long ago, my actions led to my entire squad dying.<br>Ever since, I struggle to keep myself composed when I lose a soldier...<br>He wanted to take his terrible past to the grave.<br>But considering how the eyepatch man seemed to care genuinely about<br>the lives of his soldiers, perhaps he would understand.<br>The young man feels as though he has nothing to lose.<br>Believe me, I know the feeling.<br>His one bright blue eye sparkling, he tells the young man his story.<br>He, too, lost most of his comrades in battle.<br>He's heard their voices ever since.<br>Their voices as they burned in the fires of battle.<br>He had promised that they'd survive together, but before he knew it,<br>he stood alone amidst their corpses.<br>There's loathing in his voice for how carefree he lives now.<br>Be it the past, the present, or the future, no matter where he goes,<br>that's all there is.<br>Despite his grim words, the smile on his face is as cheerful as ever.<br>But the young man realizes that the eyepatch is every bit as stained<br>by guilt as he is.<br>Silence settles between them for a time.<br>Every now and then, airplanes pass overhead like distant thunder,<br>rattling the windows. Shells whistle through the air like burnt-out stars,<br>and the glow of fire illuminates the room.<br>And then—<br>Death. Death is our only salvation.<br>At length, the eyepatch man speaks. The shocked young man turns to him.<br>The corners of his mouth turn upward slightly,<br>and he pats the young man's shoulder. "Kidding, of course."<br>We'll survive and get everyone outta here.<br>You don't wanna lose any more soldiers, right?<br>Right, the young man tells himself.<br>They're without rations or doctors in this filthy,<br>inhumane place where they make even the injured and sick work.<br>To sit here idly would be tantamount to killing his own soldiers.<br>They must put together a plan of escape, and soon.<br>The first light of dawn glows beyond the window.<br>The eyepatch man gazes at the distant gunfire and begins to him.<br>It's a song that everyone from their country knows.<br>Slowly, the sleeping soldiers are roused.<br>Though not all belong to the same squad, they all share a home.<br>One by one, they join in the humming, and before long,<br>everyone in the room is singing.<br>The guards shout as they rush in to stop them,<br>but prisoners continue to sing.<br>The eyepatch man sings even louder in encouragement.<br>Nobody here has lost hope yet.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The young man was trapped in a bombardment.<br>Along with the eyepatch man, who serves as a captain as well,<br>and a dozen or so of their soldiers, he was detained in a camp.<br>It's difficult to retain one's humanity in an environment like this.<br>The young man's spirit wavers, but the eyepatch man inspires him.<br>The young man, his soldiers,<br>and all the others still hold fast to the hope that they will see home again.<br>Beside the detention camp is a barracks, demarcated with barbed wire.<br>The soldiers stationed there occasionally come to the camp when they have<br>free time.<br>What they come to do is, essentially, trade with the captives.<br>In exchange for stale bread, they receive things from the starving prisoners<br>they might deem useful.<br>The prisoners have very little, but a handful of them possess things that are<br>worth more than bread to the soldiers.<br>Today, a soldier visits the detention camp.<br>The blond young man and the eyepatch man hand over their pocket watches<br>and demand more bread than usual—their sickly fellows need all the nutrients<br>they can get.<br>Their earnest gazes grieve for their comrades.<br>Taking pity on them, the soldier accepts the watches and brings them bread,<br>as promised.<br>The two men give their gratitude for the soldier's kindness.<br>And then, the three of them begin walking around the facility and engaging<br>in idle chatter.<br>The soldier speaks with the unarmed, starving prisoners.<br>He regards them with caution at first.<br>But he finds the eyepatch man particularly fascinating,<br>and before he realizes it, he's let his guard down.<br>He's been led down an empty corridor, a blind spot in the guards' watch.<br>The young man whirls to punch the soldier.<br>The sudden attack sends the soldier to the ground.<br>He reaches to pull a knife from his boot, but the young man straddles him,<br>depriving him of movement.<br>The soldier attempts to yell for help, but hands quickly clamp around his throat.<br>The young man then grabs the knife and stabs him repeatedly until his life<br>is extinguished.<br>The last thing he saw...<br>Was the young man's faint smile.<br><i>I've done a terrible thing</i>, the young man thinks as he looks over the<br>soldier's corpse.<br>An enemy though he was, the last thing the young man wanted was to take<br>a life outside of the battlefield.<br>But this is the day they've been waiting for—when the enemy soldier<br>with the storehouse key visits the camp.<br>All of their confiscated items are being held in storage,<br>including their weapons, according to one prisoner.<br>They will arm themselves there. They must.<br>The young man searches the soldier's clothes for the key and finds it.<br>He exchanges glances with the eyepatch man,<br>and they nod in confirmation.<br>If they remain here like they're supposed to, they'll never be able to send<br>their soldiers home alive.<br>That is the conclusion they came to. And so, they have opted to take action.<br>The young man has his soldiers, and several other P.O.W.s have been <br>nterned here before them.<br>If they all work together, they might just make it out.<br>The two captains take their chances, putting everything on the line.<br>The young man takes the keys and a gun from the soldier.<br>The bullets tear through the guards who watch the storehouse.<br>And on the eyepatch man's signal,<br>their fellow soldiers rush into the armory.<br>They take their guns and begin readying themselves for an uprising.<br>But the guards respond to the commotion much faster than the young<br>man anticipated.<br>A hail of bullets flies toward the storehouse.<br>They duck for cover with little opportunity to poke their heads out.<br>But they're prepared for this.<br>Wanna do this?<br>The eyepatch man asks the young man, who nods in response.<br>The two step forward, pistols at the ready.<br>They pay little heed to the bullets that graze their skin and dig holes into<br>the earth beside them.<br>They pull their triggers and kill their enemies,<br>risking their lives to save their allies.<br>If they can't manage that much, they have no right to live.<br>The eyepatch man has made the same resolve, the young man believes.<br>He, too, lost many of his squadmates in battle. Theirs is a shared past.<br>His deadly bullets tear through the enemy's heads, faces, necks, hearts.<br>He shoots their hands carrying their guns, their fleeing legs,<br>their sobbing eyes, their screaming mouths.<br>Are you smiling?<br>The eyepatch man asks the young man.<br><i>There's no way I'm smiling</i>, he thinks to himself,<br>but curiosity gets the better of him, and he brings his hand to his face.<br>And for the first time, he realizes he is indeed smiling.<br>It's nothing to worry about, the eyepatch man says.<br>You killed the enemy to save your soldiers.<br>That's every reason to smile, he says.<br>And so he, too, does the same—shoots an enemy soldier, then smiles.<br>Their smiles look much the same, both hiding the fear that they may lose one<br>of their own.<br>Then, they hurl grenades at the enemy and rush them.<br>They pull their triggers without mercy,<br>quickly turning the soldiers on the opposite side into corpses.<br>The two captains' silhouettes flicker in the hellfire.<br>The men who were mere prisoners only moments ago are now raging demons<br>in the eyes of the enemy soldiers.<br>They make their escape from the storehouse.<br>From there, prisoners from other countries join in the uprising.<br>They foresee victory in the young man's actions and declare their cooperation.<br>Pressing forward, they take weapons from the dead soldiers.<br>And at the end of the prolonged firefight,<br>they manage to take control of the armory in the barracks.<br>A few hours pass.<br>All that remains in the silent battlefield are the charred remains of the barracks<br>and the detention camp. The only survivors: the young man and his allies.<br>Together, they cheer and share in their joy, <br>but the young man cautions them—they should leave before pursuers arrive.<br>But when he realizes all of his squad has survived,<br>the tension in his body melts away.<br>Pain previously suppressed by adrenaline now bubbles to the surface.<br>Only now does he realize he's suffered a gunshot wound to his leg.<br>He is but a breath from collapse, but the eyepatch man keeps him up.<br>The young man gives his thanks and the older man murmurs.<br>Maybe our nightmares are a thing of the past now...<br>The young man gives a nod.<br>With the battle won, he gets to hear the laughter of his soldiers—a sweeter<br>sound he cannot imagine.<br>And so, they set off on the road to home.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">After getting caught up in a bombardment on the battlefield,<br>the soldiers were captured and taken to a detention camp.<br>But under the command of the two captains—the blond young man and the<br>man with the eyepatch—they rose to action and made a successful escape.<br>They celebrated their survival and safely returned to their home country.<br>This all took place in late summer.<br>The young man reunites with the squadmates he parted ways<br>with on the battlefield.<br>They survived the brutal fight and returned home alive.<br>Their survival is like a dream come true to the young man,<br>and his relief is immeasurable.<br>He had once led his entire squad to annihilation. But not this time.<br>Together with the eyepatch man,<br>he receives a medal of honor and a promotion.<br>They successfully carried out an operation that made up<br>for the overwhelming resource disadvantage of the previous battle<br>and freed the prisoners of war—successes held in high esteem.<br>These are accolades completely unlike the ones he bitterly received<br>in the past after the deaths of his squadmates. Rather,<br>these were things he earned as a result of protecting his soldiers.<br>The two captains are showered with praise at the medal ceremony.<br>They are heroes.<br>Bright rays of summer light beam through the windows of the lavish<br>ceremony venue.<br>This beautiful morning blesses their honor and the miracle operation.<br>In his ceremonial garb, the admiration of onlookers is palpable<br>to the young man.<br>After the ceremony, he leaves—there's somewhere he needs to go.<br>Somewhere that lies beyond the dark forest in the far corner of the city.<br>A place he's been so many times he can practically find his way there<br>with his eyes closed.<br>It's the military graveyard, the place where his fallen squadmates slumber.<br>Step by step, he makes his way toward the graves as if drawn by something.<br>And there's our answer, eh?<br>A voice comes from behind him—the very same voice that soothedand<br>inspired him time and again in the detention center.<br>He turns around, and there he finds the eyepatch man, his friend in arms.<br>His one eye, blue as the summer sky, stares straight at him.<br>Our answer?<br>Answer... The young man meditates on the word.<br>That's right—they have their answer.<br>They both lost so many squadmates due to their mistakes.<br>They both vowed not to commit the same sin again.<br>And so they proceeded to kill their enemies to protect their own.<br>At last, their vows were fulfilled.<br>Every soldier they commanded in the previous battle returned home safely.<br>Every ally held in the detention center successfully escaped.<br>They received medals.<br>They were lauded as heroes.<br>All was right.<br>They now stand atop the path they dreamed to walk.<br>They now stand in the light.<br>And yet...the nightmares do not cease.<br>Reflected in the young man's eyes is not only the eyepatch man before him<br>but the countless ghosts of his fallen men.<br>He still hears them. He still hears their curses.<br>He still hears them dragging him to the depths of hell.<br>Indeed, they have their answer.<br>No matter how much they look after their allies,<br>no matter how they risk their lives for them,<br>the damage has already been done.<br>The nightmares will never end. They have no destination.<br>Everything boils down to regret. Penitence. Guilt. Despair.<br>Whether they stand on a battlefield or in the light, that is all they have.<br>The notion occurred to him the moment he was called a hero in the ceremony.<br>But you know how to escape this hell, don't you?<br>The eyepatch man speaks.<br>He steps toward the young man, his eye examining him.<br>What you know, I know. And what I know, you know.<br>The young man stares silently back.<br>The affection he has for the other man drains from him at once.<br>This is a man who has saved him in battle countless times.<br>They both risked their lives to save their allies.<br>The warmth he felt in those moments is now completely absent.<br>But that, too, is a given, he realizes.<br>Much in the way he cannot love himself,<br>he bears no love for a man with the same sins as him.<br>But he is a special compatriot.<br>Perhaps he can grant him this wish just once.<br>The eyepatch man smiles.<br>The young man knows exactly what he wants.<br>He presses the barrel of his gun to the man's chest.<br>And without a moment's hesitation, he pulls the trigger.<br>The summer sun bathes the man's corpse,<br>lying among the blue flowers in golden light.<br>His face glows. He slumbers like an innocent boy.<br>As the young man looks down at him, he smiles in defeat.<br>Death truly is their only salvation, isn't it?<br>He then brings his gun to his temple.<br>A sweet numbness coats the skin where the warm barrel presses<br>against him.<br><i>Hurry, hurry!</i> urges the trigger.<br>Flowers bloom on the battlefield.<br>Butterflies dance beneath an azure sky.<br>A gentle breeze puffs over the horizon.<br>And in the distance, his squadmates laugh.<br>The young man bids farewell to a flickering past.<br>And then he pulls the trigger.</p>
