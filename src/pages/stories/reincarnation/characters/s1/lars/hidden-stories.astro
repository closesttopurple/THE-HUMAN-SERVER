<p class="title">Chapter 1: Sweltering Bonds (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">I walk along a dilapidated railroad lined by <br>endless fields of sunflowers. <br>High above, an uncaring sun rages against a brilliant blue sky, <br>turning the rows of blossoms into <br>paint-smeared streaks of yellow.<br><br>Oh, how I hate it all.<br><br>Time is an illusion here. <br>Hunger a constant companion. <br>My steps fall one after the other after the other, <br>until I finally see a tunnel begin to <br>materialize in the heat-shimmer distance. <br>And on the other side of it, a foreign city.<br><br>This country used to kidnap children in <br>an effort to improve its gene pool, you see. <br>And while the victims were spirited from <br>countries across the world, the majority came from <br>the city at the other end of <br>this tunnel--the city that is my true home. <br>And that is why I walk through the pain and <br>the smells and the hunger and <br>the heat: in the hope it all somehow leads me to the truth.<br><br>A woman stands at the tunnel entrance. <br>She maybe in her mid-40s, with a staff in her hand. <br>Her steely eyes stare unblinkingly at the sunflowers, <br>but as I attempt to slip past, she spins around and <br>whips a blade out of the top of her staff. <br>I manage to block it with my own, <br>and we stand there a moment, frozen in time.<br><br>"What business does a soldier have in a place like this?” <br>she asks, ire in her voice. <br>"I know that sword you hold. <br>It took the lives of countless numbers of my countrymen."<br><br>In truth, I'd brought the sword with me when I deserted the army, <br>which is why it has a military insignia on the scabbard. <br>To me, it's just a weapon--but to this woman, <br>it is the sign of her most hated enemy.<br><br>"Found it on the ground," <br>I say casually. Clearly unconvinced by my answer, <br>she makes her move. Our blades begin to ring back and <br>forth in a blur of iron and steel. Her blows are relentless, <br>her strength otherworldly. <br>Any advantage I may have had is long gone, <br>and as I desperately attempt to fend her off, <br>she lands a firm blow on the pit of my stomach, <br>crumpling me to the ground.<br><br>The woman looms over me, <br>blocking out that brilliant blue sky. <br>She raises her blade above her head and <br>prepares to claim my life, but before she can act, <br>another voice calls out from inside the tunnel.<br><br>"Captain! Enemy approaching!"<br><br><i>An enemy attack? No. Oh, no.</i><br><br>As my attacker lowers her weapon and <br>turns to face this new threat, <br>I manage to tilt my head toward the disturbance. <br>It's a squadron of soldiers all dressed in <br>the familiar uniform of my old intel corps. <br>Were they here for <i>me</i>? <br>Did they really follow me all the way out here? <br><br>"Beat them back!” <br>cries the captain. <br>"Do not let them touch the sunflowers!"<br><br>On her command, <br>armed villagers pour out of the tunnel and <br>begin battling my old companions. <br>They fight well, these commoners—better than <br>I would have expected. But before I can see more, <br>the pain of my wounds floods through me, <br>turning the sounds of gunfire and screams into <br>the hush of distant rain on <br>a windowpane before fading out altogether.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Sunflower Child (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">"You don't have much of a talent for housework, I see.”<br><br>This scolding comes as I sweep the living room, <br>and I turn to see the owner of this house: <br>the same captain who attacked me on <br>the railroad two days prior. She was permitting me to <br>stay in a spare room by way of apology for injuring me<br>—which would have been a kinder gesture had she not <br>also demanded that I clean and run errands to <br>pay for room and board.<br><br>"I'm leaving for patrol. Make sure you clean <br>every inch of this place. Got it?”<br><br>This border city lives in constant danger of invasion, <br>and the captain leads a militia that helps to keep it safe. <br>She apparently attacked me because <br>she thought I was the enemy<br>—a mistake put to rights the moment she saw <br>my former intel companions arrive and attempt to kill me. <br>Regardless, I've had enough of this arrangement; <br>I'm going to leave this house tonight <br>if it's the last thing I do. <br>But as I whip the broom around and <br>send dust flying through the air, <br>the air is split by a sudden thunder so <br>loud it almost tears my ears from their moorings.<br><br>Shaking the cobwebs free, <br>I rush to a nearby window and see a cannon firing <br>giant ball of water high into the sky. <br>The unusual missile flies through the air and <br>over the tunnel before bursting apart and <br>showering the fields of sunflowers on either side of <br>the railroad tracks. <br>The droplets glitter as they fall through the blue, <br>and I find myself utterly entranced by the sight.<br><br>"We lost so many children,” <br>murmurs the captain behind me. <br>"So many stolen from us. <br>We planted a sunflower for every one of them.”<br><br>As she says this, <br>I realize one of those flowers was planted for me. <br>On the heels of that, <br>I suddenly imagine a man looking at the flowers and <br>thinking of his kidnapped child. He's a soldier<br>—the same one I killed to take revenge for my family. <br>But in truth, the parents I had cared for and <br>loved so dearly were the same people who <br>kidnapped me from my home all those years ago. <br>And the other man? The one I killed for revenge?<br><br>Well, he was my true father.<br><br>"So many of us are still waiting for their <br>sunflowers to come home. Even now. Even still."<br><br>The woman's voice brings me back to reality, <br>but I don't want to see the shadow <br>I know is clouding her eyes. <br>So instead of replying, I look away<br>—because I don't have the time or patience to <br>deal with such nonsense.<br><br>When midnight arrives, <br>I gather my things and leave the house. <br>My injuries were manageable, <br>and I'd had more than my share of chores<br>—but more importantly, <br>I wanted to learn more about the abductions. <br>After walking for a while, <br>I come to one of the city's main avenues and <br>spy the captain hurrying along with a lantern in her hand.<br><br>My curiosity piqued, I hide in the shadows <br>and follow the bouncing glow of <br>her lamp until we arrive at the other side of the tunnel, <br>where walks over to a sunflower and <br>begins to whisper to herself. <br>But the night is still, and her hush carries to my position. <br>It's a name—the same name, <br>said in a rush over and over and over again.<br><br>I take a step backward. <br>Two. <br>I don't want to believe what I'm hearing, <br>but my ears do not lie. <br>Because the name the captain is repeating to <br>the uncaring night?<br><br>It's mine.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Sin's Shadow (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">I set the bucket down next<br>to the cannon and attempt to<br>stretch the cricks out of my<br>back. Every morning, this<br>cannon fires water across the<br>sky and over the sunflowers<br>that stand sentinel at the<br>entrance to the city. But<br>all that water doesn't carry<br>itself, so it's the job of<br>the town militia to fill the<br>buckets and carry them up and<br>down, up and down, over and<br>over again. And as the newest<br>member of the militia, I'm<br>now achingly familiar with<br>exactly how lousy the job is.<br><br>"Thanks for the help, new<br>guy," says a brawny man as he<br>picks up my bucket. He dumps<br>it into the cannon with a<br>practiced hand, then turns to<br>me and smiles.<br><br>"This might get loud."<br><br>An earth-shattering explosion<br>rings out, sending a sphere<br>of water flying toward the<br>edge of the city. As I look<br>down from the platform upon<br>which we're perched, I see<br>children playing on an<br>abandoned train car; they<br>look up and cheer with delight<br>as the orb soars overhead.<br><br>"Captain started this whole<br>cannon business six months<br>ago," says my burly companion<br>as he wipes sweat from his<br>forehead. "Thought she was<br>nuts at first, but now it's<br>the highlight of everyone's<br>day. Go figure."<br><br>"Well, I still think it's<br>nuts. Haven't you people<br>ever heard of a hose?"<br><br>The other man grins. "This<br>ain't about being efficient;<br>Captain wants to prove that<br>weapons can be used for more<br>than just killing. Came up<br>with the idea right around the<br>time her husband died in<br>battle, so maybe that's where<br>it came from."<br> <br>The captain's husband? He was<br>my real father—and the very<br>man I killed. But I can't let<br>on to this, so I give a vague<br>mumble in reply and climb down<br>from the observation deck.<br>There's still plenty of work<br>to be done, after all.<br><br>In the afternoon, I head to<br>the market with the captain<br>to purchase items for soldiers<br>who've been injured in battle.<br>Once we pick up whatever they<br>need, we'll bring it to them<br>ourselves. Between hauling<br>water and playing delivery<br>boy, this is easily the most<br>boring militia I've ever<br>heard of—and yet, I find<br>myself sticking around.<br><br>"I've got this one," I say,<br>taking a package from the<br>captain's hands.<br><br>"I don't need your help," she<br>says sternly before breaking<br>out into the smile that I'd<br>started seeing more and more<br>over the past few weeks.<br>"But...I appreciate it."<br><br>Later, we arrive at the<br>soldiers' homes with the<br>provisions. The captain hands<br>them over and engages each and<br>every person in conversation.<br>I've never been much for idle<br>chit-chat, so I pass the time<br>by loitering in the yard.<br><br>After several such visits,<br>we come to a house where she<br>stays inside much longer than<br>usual. From where I stand,<br>it seems to be a conversation<br>between friends; the patter<br>is rapid, and I hear frequent<br>peals of laughter from the<br>pair of them. <br><br>After waiting around for what<br>I consider to be a generous<br>period of time, I finally<br>lose my patience and storm<br>into the house to hurry things<br>along. But when my eyes lock<br>onto the other person in the<br>room—a man with a prosthetic<br>leg—the laughter suddenly<br>stops. The joy and color<br>drains from the man's face<br>as an ominous mood settles<br>over the room.<br><br>"YOU!" cries the man. With a<br>speed that belies his injury,<br>he leaps from the couch,<br>tackles me to the floor,<br>and wraps his hand around my<br>throat. "I'll never forget<br>you! Never! NEVER!"<br><br>"Stop it! Get off him!"<br><br>The captain wraps her arms<br>around the man and yanks him<br>off me as he continues to<br>protest. I want to tell him<br>to stop—I want to <i>scream</i>.<br>But my breath has abandoned<br>me, and all I can do is pray<br>that it returns.<br><br>"He's the one, Captain!<br>He's the enemy soldier<br>who killed your husband!"<br> <br>Silence. Deafening. Eternal.<br><br>"Is this true?" asks the<br>captain in a trembling voice.<br>I want to respond, but my body<br>is shaking too hard. I've<br>never been this scared—not in<br>any battle, not from any man.<br>The silence grows and thickens<br>until it feels like it will<br>smother the life out of the<br>three of us and leave nothing<br>behind but dust.<br><br>"Get out of here. Leave.<br>I don't ever want to see<br>your face again."<br><br>I start to stammer something—<br>some pathetic explanation—<br>but she turns to me with<br>blade in hand, just as she<br>did the first day we met.<br>Yet the look in her eyes is<br>much fiercer than it was then;<br>a wild thing that shows a<br>person on the edge of losing<br>everything that might possibly<br>make her human.<br><br>"NOW!"<br><br>My quivering legs somehow<br>propel me out of the house<br>and through the streets of<br>town. I curse my stupidity<br>as I run, bemoaning how I'd<br>stayed with the captain in<br>some pathetic attempt to<br>repent for how I'd torn her<br>life apart. But here's the<br>funny thing: I actually<br>thought I could do it.<br>I actually thought I might<br>be able to make amends.<br><br>Ah, but that was the wish<br>of a fool.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Midnight Flames (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">I urge myself forward.<br>One more step and my ragged<br>breath echoes in the dark.<br>One more step and my lungs<br>burn pure fire. One more step.<br>One more step. One more. <br><br>"<i>I don't ever want to see<br>your face again.</i>"<br><br>The Captain's words play in my<br>brain without pause, which is<br>why I'd originally planned to<br>never return to the city after<br>the night I abandoned it three<br>months prior. But then I<br>learned it had fallen into<br>enemy hands, so now I am<br>running back, running with<br>everything I have, all so I<br>might reach a woman who wants<br>nothing more than to never see<br>me again.<br><br>I finally reach the city's<br>rear gates and step through.<br>Taking a deep breath, I look<br>around, my eyes scarcely able<br>to process what they see.<br><br>The hardy merchants who kept<br>trading despite short supplies.<br>The disciplined members of the<br>militia. The children who<br>loved to play in the abandoned<br>train cars. All the people who<br>once made the city a living,<br>breathing thing are now charred<br>corpses smoking on the ground.<br>The world is silent and still,<br>save for the occasional gust<br>of wind and the uncaring<br>crackle of flame. <br><br>Eventually, I discover the<br>body of the brawny militia<br>member in the rubble of what<br>remains of the cannon.<br>The pungent scent of gunpowder<br>is still strong, even though<br>it was now used to fire water.<br>As I press on, I find only<br>death. A familiar face here,<br>a name on the wind there.<br>But what I cannot seem to find<br>is the body of the Captain—the<br>very reason I came back in the<br>first place.<br><br><i>Could it be? Is it possible?</i><br><br>Instinct quickly bubbles into<br>outright conviction, and I<br>set off at a run for the<br>sunflowers she loved above all<br>things. But when I emerge on<br>the other side of the tunnel,<br>I'm horrified to find the<br>fields ablaze, the flowers<br>transformed into an endless<br>river of fire under the dark<br>night sky. Against their light,<br>I finally see a familiar figure<br>lying on the tracks.<br><br>I race to the Captain's side<br>and take an involuntary step<br>back, aghast. Her body is an<br>ocean of bloody wounds, her<br>breath a rasp. How many had<br>she fought to get here?<br>How many of them did it take<br>to finally lay her low?<br><br>"I'm...sorry..."<br><br>Her mouth parts slightly as<br>these words escape, and I drop<br>to my knees and cradle her in<br>my arms. She's cold—<i>so</i> cold.<br>How can someone be this cold<br>when everything around us is<br>nothing but fire and madness? <br><br>"I just wanted...<br>to see my boy..."<br><br>Each of the sunflowers planted<br>here represented a child that<br>was stolen. So the Captain<br>didn't see them as flowers,<br>but her son. That was why she<br>came at the end of her life.<br><br>"I just wanted to see him..."<br><br>She repeats the phrase over<br>and over, losing a little more<br>of herself in the process.<br><br>"I just wanted to see him...<br>I just wanted to see him...<br>I just wanted to see him..."<br><br><i>But he's here, Mom.<br>He's right in front of you.</i><br><br>I wanted to tell her the<br>truth, but I also knew it<br>would make her last moments<br>even more painful. After all,<br>I was the same person who'd<br>killed her husband not six<br>months before. So instead,<br>I hold her hand in mine and<br>say nothing. Eventually it<br>slips from my grasp and<br>settles on the ground. A petal<br>from one of the sunflowers<br>drifts out of the fire and<br>flutters toward us, and by the<br>time it joins her hand on the<br>earth, she is gone.<br><br>"I'll come see you someday,"<br>I whisper. "I swear it."<br>But as sparks crackle off the<br>sunflowers and drift away into<br>the gloomy night, it feels<br>like the dawn has never been<br>so far away.</p>
