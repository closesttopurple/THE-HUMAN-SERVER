<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">Cheers ring out from the dusty barracks. In a shift from the tense atmosphere on the eve<br>of their operation, the soldiers now laugh easily with each other as they celebrate the great victory<br>they have won. "Cheers!" Golden ale flows freely and without formality of rank. The men drain<br>glass after glass, scarcely noticing how much they are spilling in the process. Their unit had<br>secured a miraculous victory, and this party is their reward. But they are drunk on more than ale<br>this night; they took on an impossible mission and came back alive, and this fact alone makes<br>their heads swim and their speech giddy. Men brag of their accomplishments in battle. They brag<br>about the beauty of their wives. Every lip is loosened and free. Apparently some of the soldiers<br>even earned promotions for their valor on the mission.<br><br>But inside this bright atmosphere, a single young soldier sits apart from the others with<br>a glum look on his face. He had infiltrated the enemy base alone—against the orders of his direct<br>commander—and slain the enemy captain. Though their victory was due in large part to this deed,<br>his actions were still troubling. No matter how well it had turned out, he had ignored a direct order<br>from a superior; a court-martial would be unsurprising. That he did so because of a personal<br>grudge is perhaps the most troubling fact of all. By all rights, he should have died on that battlefield.<br>But his life was saved by his fellow soldiers—and especially by the quick thinking and bravery of<br>the very captain whose orders he was so quick to disregard. Regardless, the boy sits alone, not<br>bothering to thank the men around him or share a meal or drink. His mind is still back with the<br>enemy commander. The same man who killed his parents so long ago. After years of chasing him,<br>the boy had finally cornered his target and plunged his weapon into his heart, along with all of his<br>hate. But the fall of the curtain on his revenge was hollow. He felt no exhilaration.<br>No accomplishment. Instead, he was left with the empty bones of a past he could never reclaim.<br>With that gloomy sadness filling the boy's head, the dying enemy captain spoke to him. He told<br>the boy something that turned everything he'd ever believed on its head. And now, he sits<br>among his celebrating fellows and replays the words over and over again in his mind:<br><i>The secret of my birth. My past. My true father.</i> It is so farfetched as to stretch the bounds of<br>credulity, and yet he is unable to set it aside.<br><br>The boy stares blankly into space. The drink in his hand has long since grown warm,<br>but he pays it no mind. Suddenly, a brawny soldier approaches him. Ignoring his troubled state,<br>he plops down beside him with a most inconsiderate thud. This man had always treated the boy<br>harshly—more like an enemy than a fellow soldier in the ranks.<br><br>"You here to pick another fight?" asks the boy. He can't even bother to lift his head for the query,<br>feeling all the more gloomy from the man's presence.<br>"Fight? No, boy. I'm damn proud of you."<br>The boy is shocked to hear actual praise coming from the man. So shocked that he looks up in<br>spite of himself. There's a slight hint of envy in the words, as if the man wishes he had the guts<br>to disobey orders and sneak off to kill the enemy. Regardless, the boy finds the compliment<br>embarrassing. Quickly lowering his head to hide the flush on his cheeks, he stands and makes<br>his way to the exit.<br><br>"Goin' for a piss, there?" asks the brawny man. The boy gives a vague response and<br>ducks outside.<br><br>Night has fallen on the land. The silence is so perfect—especially when compared to the<br>chaos of the barracks—that it causes his ears to ring. Camaraderie and banter did not come easily<br>to him by nature, but that is not the reason for his discomfort this night. He has so many things<br>to think about. And here, in the dark, his thoughts are free to run rampant. He stands there for a<br>long time, until a sound finally causes him to turn around. An injured soldier is behind him, leaning<br>on a crutch. He looks at the boy and cuts straight to the point:<br>"So, what were you doing in the enemy camp?"</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The night had deepened, the surroundings now fully dark. Faint light streams out from the<br>windows of the barracks. The soldiers inside were still busy drinking and boasting. But here, away<br>from all the sound and bluster, two fellow soldiers face each other in silence. The boy studies his<br>unexpected visitor. He is young, with strong features and a shock of blond hair. But his most<br>noticeable characteristics are his blue eyes, which seem to shine with their own inner light. The<br>boy usually pays no mind to the appearance of others, but even he remembered that distinguishing<br>feature. He is one of the soldiers who received a promotion. Recalling that, the boy's puzzlement<br>only grows. Gazing upon the soldier before him, he thinks back on the question he was asked.<br><i>He asked me what I was doing in the base.</i> <i>We're not even particularly close, so why is he<br>starting this conversation with me?</i> <i>And why did he wait until we were alone to approach me?</i><br><br>"I can't answer you unless I know why you're asking."<br>The blue-eyed soldier stares back at him.<br><br>Then, after a moment, he begins to tell his tale.<br><br>"We were part of the operation."<br>"My squad arrived at the camp after you killed the commander."<br>"The enemy was in total disarray, and we were able to dispatch the stragglers with relative ease."<br>"Once that was done, we searched their camp."<br>"And guess what I found?"<br>"A confidential file marked with the crest of <i>our</i> army."<br>"Naturally, I was curious how this ended up in enemy hands, so I picked it up to take a closer look."<br>"But before I could open it, someone attacked me from behind and knocked me unconscious."<br>"When I woke up, the file was gone."<br>"But here's the thing: We neutralized the enemy soldiers—every last one of them. So who the<br>hell attacked me?"<br><br>The boy starts.<br>"Are you saying <i>I</i> attacked you?"<br><br>The other soldier locks his blue eyes on the boy.<br><br>"That's my guess, yeah."<br>"I mean, you disobeyed orders, right? Infiltrated the camp and killed the commander all by<br>your lonesome?"<br>"Even you have to admit that's suspicious."<br>"So I'll ask you again: What were you doing in the enemy base?"<br><br>When the boy finally speaks again, he chooses his words carefully. He tells the blue-eyed<br>soldier how his parents had been killed when he was young. How the killer was the enemy<br>commander. How he became a soldier specifically to find that man and end his life. And how he<br>didn't care if he would end up court-martialed, because his revenge would be worth any price.<br>The blue-eyed soldier remains silent. It's as if he's trying to discern the truth in the boy's words.<br>Silence settles between the two soldiers. In the quiet, the boy thinks about his comrade's story.<br><i>He found one of our confidential files in the enemy base.</i> <i>But before he could read it, someone<br>attacked him and stole it.</i> <i>Someone from our army.</i> <i>Is that file related to what the enemy<br>commander told me?</i> <i>Does it relate to our country's past? And does it hold the answers I need?</i><br>After a bit, the blue-eyed soldier nods and turns away, apparently satisfied that the boy is innocent.<br><br>"Wait!" cries the boy.<br>The man stops.<br><br>"What happened to the file?"<br>"Well, if my suspicions are correct and it was taken by one of us, it should be in the vault here<br>at the base."<br><br>He then turns back to the boy and adds:<br>"But don't go getting any stupid ideas."<br>"You already disobeyed orders once, and it won't go well if you do it again. So just keep your<br>head down, okay?"<br><br>He then departs, limping away on his crutch. But his warning falls on deaf ears. For the boy<br>would do anything to know what is in that file.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para"><i>Why did he tell me that story in the first place?</i> <i>He clearly thinks we have a traitor in our<br>midst.</i> <i>He made contact in hopes of finding out who it is, so maybe we can form a partnership and...</i><br>The boy lets this thought marinate in his mind for a bit before suddenly rejecting it. If the<br>file <i>does</i> contain the secret of his birth, he doesn't want anyone else knowing about it. He<br>begins to formulate a plan. The blue-eyed soldier is likely correct: If the file was stolen by a<br>traitor, it would be located in the vault.<br><br>Their base is a large, sprawling complex with many buildings. There are barracks, a<br>training ground, a reference library... And the vault, which is only accessible to a select group<br>of people. Now in the library, the boy finds himself staring at a set of blueprints for the base.<br>Coated in dust and weathered away to a dim yellow color, they seem ready to fall apart in his<br>hands. But he finds the part he wants, carefully tears it away, and quickly sidles out of the<br>room. It is the route to the vault.<br><br>The boy makes his way to the changing room. But not to don a disguise. Instead, he<br>climbs on top of a locker and removes a dusty wire panel covering an exhaust duct. A duct that<br>leads to the vault. He always cursed his small physique, but is now thrilled to have it. Drawing<br>his shoulders tight, he manages to squeeze inside. Holding his flashlight between his cheek<br>and his shoulder, he wriggles his way forward like an inchworm. Every movement brings a new<br>puff of dust or a cobweb brushing against his face. He struggles desperately against the urge<br>to cough. But just as he is about to lose hope......he arrives at his destination. According to the<br>blueprints, the vault is directly below him. With a sigh of relief, he reaches out to the wire panel.<br>But he can't get it free. Anger suddenly races through him, and he makes a rash decision.<br>Applying all of his strength to it, he shoves the panel until it breaks apart with a crack loud<br>enough to wake the dead. The boy scans the inside of the vault, certain that he has alerted a<br>guard or triggered some kind of alarm. The only source of light is a dimly illuminated exit sign.<br>When no one comes to investigate, the boy lets out a sigh of relief. Wiping a bit of sweat from<br>his brow, he lowers himself down. The vault is filled with row after row of metal shelves. Each<br>shelf has a number, with contents organized by date and type, such as confidential documents<br>or artifacts claimed from the enemy. The boy roams through the rows, shining his light here and<br>there. He checks dates on the confiscated items and opens any file that seems like it might be<br>relevant to his interests. Finally, he stumbles across a folder with the word "Confidential"<br>stamped across it.<br><br>It also contains the seal of their army. Just like the one from the other soldier's tale.<br>The boy takes a deep breath and opens it. The words inside immediately draw his eye:<br>"INFANT ABDUCTION STRATEGY"<br>His heart begins to race. With a single trembling finger, he reaches out and slowly turns the page.<br>It is a complete accounting of his country's actions. The plan was designed to create powerful<br>soldiers. They researched genes from people across the world, looking for those with the traits<br>they sought. Before long, they had a pool of possible recruits. Once an infant was found from a<br>desired genetic line, they were kidnapped and raised as one of their own citizens. Everything the<br>enemy commander had told him was true. And with each line he reads, the boy's long-held beliefs<br>collapse. It is a pain unlike anything he has ever felt.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">Here, in the darkest part of his nation, the boy has uncovered the harshest of truths.<br>The file. The vault. His history. The "Infant Abduction Strategy." The words of his hated enemy.<br>The words on the page. It was all coming together. His head reels. His chest tightens. He feels<br>like he is about to faint.<br><br>But he does not. More precisely, he <i>will</i> not. Because he had to avoid the blade of the<br>knife that is racing up behind him. Perhaps it is the boy's natural instincts that warn him;<br>perhaps the superior genes that were mentioned in the file. Regardless, he twists his head to<br>the side and narrowly avoids having it separated from his shoulders. The weapon is a military-issue<br>combat knife. His attacker is a man in a mask. A thin ribbon of blood oozes down his neck<br>where the knife had brushed it. Though the boy does not understand what is happening, his<br>training takes over and he readies himself for a fight. His attacker had hoped to kill the boy from<br>behind, which meant his plan was already falling apart. Taking advantage of this brief lapse, the<br>boy twists to the side and spins around to face his attacker. He grabs his arm by the elbow and<br>wrist, locking it in place. Then he shoves the man into a nearby wall and tears off his mask.<br>To reveal... A pair of beautiful blue eyes. The boy is stunned for the briefest of moments. But it<br>is enough. The attacker twists his arm from the boy's grasp and backs away from him. <br><br>"Well, that was damn unlucky," says the man.<br>"Or maybe you're just better than I thought."<br>"Also, I thought I told you not to get any stupid ideas."<br><br>It was true: the man had given him a warning. But the boy had ignored it, and now they were<br>facing off once more. This time, there would be no talk. No parley. Instead, only one of them<br>would leave the vault alive. The blue-eyed soldier snarls at the boy. It is a sound of anger,<br>sadness, and indecision.<br><br>"Do you think I WANTED to do this!?"<br>"You think I WANTED to stab a fellow soldier in the back!?"<br><br>The blue-eyed man then tells the boy a shocking truth: The chatter at the party about<br>the "blue-eyed guy being promoted" was based on a lie. He had actually been transferred to<br>the national intelligence corps. There, he was ordered to feign injury while eliminating anyone who<br>might threaten state secrets. One of those targets was the boy, who had attracted attention<br>when he ignored orders and entered the enemy camp alone. His superiors ordered him to test<br>the boy by revealing confidential information in order to see where his true loyalties lay.<br><br>"Goddammit," breathes the man when his tale is done.<br>"GODDAMMIT!"<br><br>His emotions take hold, and he lunges at the boy. But the younger soldier calmly dodges the<br>blow and takes a couple of steps back, waiting for an opportunity to deploy the small knife he<br>has hidden on his person. <i>You came here expecting prey</i>, thinks the boy. <i>But in the end, I am<br>the one hunting you.</i> The man screams and lunges at the boy again, but the attack is sloppy and<br>easily dodged. As his foe lumbers past, the boy pulls his knife from its sheath and draws it across<br>the man's throat. The blue-eyed man falls to his knees, gasping. He presses his hands against his<br>throat, but the blood simply courses through his fingers. As his heartbeat slows, he leans against<br>a wall and slowly slumps to the floor. The light in his beautiful blue eyes dims. The boy gazes into<br>them quietly.<br><br>He does so for a very long time. When he finally comes back to reality, the man is no longer<br>breathing. Sheets of paper from the file are scattered at his feet. He picks up one blood-soaked<br>page and looks it over. It is a list of all the children who had been abducted. The plan had been<br>in place for some time, long enough that many of his superiors and fellow soldiers were likely<br>victims of it. They had been stolen from other countries, incorporated into a new nation, and given<br>fake lives—just as he had been. Unable to collect his chaotic thoughts, he finds himself presented<br>with a cruel truth: By killing a man who was supposed to be on his side, he finds himself with<br>nothing left to trust. Not his country, not his fellow soldiers, and not even himself.<br><br>Anger. Sadness. Unease. Fear. Hate.<br><br>All these emotions swirl and churn in his heart.<br>"So then... What should I live for?"<br><br>The words that spill from his quivering lips are quickly swallowed up by the darkness.</p>
