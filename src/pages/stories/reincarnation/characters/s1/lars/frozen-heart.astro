<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">The summer night swelters. The air is still. A roar of flame<br>climbs over the darkened suburbs and into the starry sky.<br>The labor camp beyond the barbed wire burns.<br>An alarm signals an emergency.<br>"We're under attack!" cry the guards.<br>The workers' footsteps become a frenzied pounding as they seek escape.<br>The sudden fires throw the inside of the building into chaos.<br>A small girl of meager years races down the burning corridor,<br>her wails echoing off the walls.<br>"Quickly! This way!"<br>A guard grabs her hand and attempts to pull her away.<br>His plan is to take the sobbing girl away from the fire and outside to safety.<br>But instead, she looks up with frightened eyes and digs her heels in tight.<br>Her response is understandable.<br>For she is a worker at the camp.<br>Her life has been a litany of abuses at the hands of the military, including guards like him.<br>So when he grabs her hand, her fear instinct kicks in, and she is unable to move.<br>His irritation rising, the guard raises his voice.<br>"Do as I say, girl! Take advantage of the chaos and get out of—"<br>His words grind to a halt.<br>The girl stares at the blade that now protrudes from his chest.<br>Someone has stabbed him from behind with a rapier.<br>"You..."<br>The guard musters what remains of his hate to turn and face the figure behind him.<br>It is a slim young man with silver hair.<br>In his fading consciousness, the guard recalls a wanted poster he has seen countless times.<br>It showed the image of the young man who now stands before him; of this there is no doubt.<br>The army has been searching for him,<br>for he leads a group of insurgents who attack labor camps such as this.<br>And it is him and his people who caused this chaos.<br>The bloodied blade slides from the guard's body.<br>His corpse slips into a puddle of blood on the ground.<br>"Nnngh..."<br>The girl trembles to see the tragic sight before her. Her legs are heavy weights.<br>The young man wipes his bloody blade on the fallen<br>guard's clothes before turning his attention to the girl.<br>"Come on. We're getting out of here."<br>There is one reason he and his comrades attack the army's forced-labor camps:<br>They seek to free children captured by the Infant<br>Abduction Strategy and absorb them into their ranks.<br>The Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>It is a secret operation in which this country's army kidnaps genetically<br>superior children from foreign countries and trains them to be soldiers.<br>Those who prove ill-suited for warfare are instead thrown into labor camps.<br>The young man was abducted as part of this operation.<br>And though he fought for his new country for a short time,<br>he deserted once he learned the truth of his background.<br>Now, he attacks their camps alongside those who are also fueled by a<br>desire for revenge, freeing the laborers before taking them in as companions.<br>One day, he will find and kill the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy—the man<br>who tore him from his parents and made his life a misery.<br>But in order to accomplish this task, he needs fighters of his own.<br>A dozen or so of his people wait for him outside the burning camp.<br>The children who had been working there gather around them.<br>As the young man sends the girl over to the others, one of<br>his compatriots—a man with freckles—offers a report:<br>"He's still not back."<br><i>He</i> is one of their fellows who often acts outside of orders.<br>"Again?"<br>Unable to hide his irritation, the young man clicks his tongue.<br>"What's the plan?" asked the freckled man.<br>Even if they decide to launch a search, the camp is engulfed in flame.<br>And while they are safe at the moment, enemy reinforcements are surely on the way.<br>But...<br>"Take the kids and get out of here. I'll catch up."<br>There is no hesitation in the young man's voice.<br>Once he finishes speaking, he steps back inside the burning camp.<br>Flames billow in every corner. Superheated air burns in his lungs.<br>But the young man with silver hair continues to search<br>for his compatriot—and at last, he finds him.<br>A boy sits on the ground, his back leaning against the wall.<br>His pitch-black hair—a rare feature in this part of the<br>world—shines brightly in the light of the billowing flames.<br>He has taken a gunshot wound to his leg—but though it<br>has rendered him immobile, it does not appear fatal.<br>The young man sighs in relief before offering a cutting remark:<br>"Pretty sure this wasn't where I ordered you to be."<br>"I'm not apologizing."<br>The black-haired boy is defiant. His gaze drops to the dead<br>soldiers scattered on the ground around him.<br>"I don't care about saving kids; I just want to kill as many of these bastards as I can."<br>After being taken through the Infant Abduction Strategy,<br>the boy was deemed ill-suited for combat and sent to a labor camp.<br>He now harbors a deep hatred for the soldiers that abused him.<br>As his leader, the young man finds this desire for revenge to be the height of selfishness.<br>But he reprimands the boy no further.<br>Instead, he slings him over his shoulders and silently moves back up the flaming corridor.<br>Eventually, he manages four words:<br>"I'm glad you survived."<br>They fall from his mouth without warning.<br>The young man understands why his subordinate acts as he does.<br>When he was part of the army, he also made the same mistakes<br>over and over in an attempt to avenge his parents.<br>And every time, it was his captain and squadmates who pulled him from the fire.<br>The black-haired boy reminds the young man <i>so</i> much of his earlier self.<br>And when he thinks of it that way, he finds he cannot abandon him to fate.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">When he was yet small, the young man's parents were killed by an enemy army,<br>after which he became a soldier so he might avenge them.<br>But...<br>Once his revenge was complete, he was forced to face an empty truth:<br>Those he believed were his parents were actually not.<br>They were merely a couple attempting to raise a kidnapped child into the perfect soldier.<br>And...<br>The person he killed to avenge his parents was his true father.<br>On that day, he found his resolve.<br>He would seek out and kill the man who devised the Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>The top-secret military operation that had ruined his life.<br>So he gathered people who harbored the same resentment,<br>a group that grew more powerful by the day.<br>They made their headquarters in a corner of a destitute area,<br>acting as a kind of vigilante group in the region.<br>Violence had once been a staple of life in the area, but since the young man and his group arrived,<br>it had grown safe enough for children to play outdoors.<br>But...<br>Today, things are different.<br>A symphony of gunshots and heavy bootheels fills the air.<br>The young man's compatriots fall in a hail of bullets, their bodies trampled without mercy.<br>Innocent villagers are caught in the crossfire.<br>The group has attacked so many labor camps that the<br>enemy army was finally able to locate their headquarters.<br>As the young man shouts orders in an attempt to repel the siege,<br>the gears in his head continue to turn.<br>The enemy had marched right into their stronghold without<br>activating any traps or setting off even a single alarm.<br>Even the best-trained soldiers could not accomplish such a feat.<br>It's as if they knew exactly where to step.<br>Is it possible? Could someone on the inside be providing them intelligence?<br>As doubt scrambles for purchase in the young man's heart, he shakes his head.<br>Everyone on his side fights for the same objective; none would ever do such a thing.<br>He shouts another order and draws his sword. As he does,<br>the freckled man rushes to his side.<br>"I'll hold them off," he says. "Take any who can still fight and get out of here."<br>The young man opens his mouth, thinking to reject<br>the man's proposed course of action.<br>But he falters under the man's straightforward gaze.<br>The freckled man continues:<br>"We need you to live."<br>His eyes bear down on the young man with determination and confidence.<br>He will entrust all that is left to him so he might accomplish<br>their mission: revenge on those who ruined their lives with the Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>And...<br>He could not find it in his heart to betray the resolve of his compatriots.<br>That is the answer the young man arrived at.<br>He takes any who can still move and escapes the burning stronghold.<br>Dawn is still a distant dream.<br>The remaining dozen or so fighters sit together in a remote ruin and speak of what is to come.<br>They have somehow evaded any pursuers along the way.<br>But the army knows the direction in which they took flight, so they cannot escape them for long.<br>And yet, the young man can't let the responsibility he has been entrusted with go to waste.<br>"We need to kill the man in charge of the Infant Abduction<br>Strategy before we're found. Only then will our revenge be complete."<br>They know their target is stationed in a domestic military facility.<br>The young man produces a sketched set of facility blueprints<br>they obtained for just this moment, then begins laying our their plan in a hoarse voice.<br>The remaining dozen or so fighters will infiltrate the facility and kill key military personnel.<br>It is a plan most reckless.<br>But if they are going to be tracked down and cornered anyway, fighting is a better option than running.<br>Or at least, that's how the young man sees it.<br>"I'm not asking you to come with me," he continues. "I want as many of you to survive as—"<br>"I'm going."<br>Who interrupts, other than the black-haired boy?<br>The one who acts of his own accord; the one who has caused the young man no end of grief.<br>"I didn't stick with you all this time to <i>survive</i>," says the boy. "I did it for revenge."<br>When he speaks, the rest nod in determination before raising their voices in support of the plan.<br>And though the young man has nowhere left to turn, he at least has his comrades.<br>Dawn breaks. Faint light flickers in through rural foliage.<br>The silver-haired young man and black-haired boy patrol the area around the ruins in which they hide.<br>Suddenly, the boy comes to a halt, staring up at the vanishing stars.<br>The gruff air he typically carries has faded into the shadows.<br>"If we fail, we'll die," he murmurs.<br>"Pretty much," replies the young man.<br>"But what happens if we succeed?"<br>The boy levels his gaze on the young man.<br>"I've always wondered that: How am I supposed to live once I have my revenge?"<br>The young man has no answer.<br>At first, he lived to exact revenge on the foreign soldier who killed his<br>parents, only to learn the man was actually his real father.<br>Since that day, he has lived for revenge on those who kidnapped him as a part of the<br>Infant Abduction Strategy. That thought alone carries him through the endless days of fighting.<br>Now that he thinks about it, vengeance has been his <i>entire</i> reason for living.<br>He has forgotten what it is like to live without it.<br>"We'll figure it out once it's over," says the young man finally. "Until then, we just need to survive."<br>The black-haired boy gives a sad smile unlike his typical brusque self.<br>And...<br>The young man returns from patrol and falls into his bunk. When he wakes up, he finds the boy gone.<br>All that remains are his belongings.<br>They search his bag and find a single piece of paper. Written on it is the day's<br>temperature and weather, as well as a description of the townsfolk.<br>The boy's comrades tilt their head at the nonsensical letter. Why has he left this?<br>But the young man understands.<br>"It's a code."<br>It is terribly similar to one the military uses, which means they<br>cannot decipher it without a matching decoder.<br>But the question the young man had is now solved.<br>The army had known exactly what to expect when they attacked, and that was most certainly due to...<br>The young man decides to accept his betrayal.<br>But...<br>He remembers how sad the boy's smile was at dawn.<br>The image is seared into his mind. He will never forget it.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The young man wades through waist-deep water along<br>with a dozen or so of his compatriots.<br>In the dead of night, they are making their way through a sewer.<br>It connects to a canal that surrounds the military facility,<br>and is the optimal path for sneaking in while avoiding detection.<br>Their destination is the facility's control room.<br>The man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy—the program that took<br>them from their homelands and ruined their lives—should be waiting there.<br>They will kill him, and in doing so have their revenge.<br>That is their plan.<br>The sewers are silent, save for the occasional ripple of disturbed water.<br>The enemy does not seem to know they are there.<br>But they all know that is likely not the case, and so proceed with the utmost caution.<br>The black-haired boy always acted on his own accord.<br>He left proof he had been working with the enemy before vanishing from the group.<br>But before he did so, they informed him of their plan to infiltrate the facility.<br>Though the young man changed the date, time, and route of the operation,<br>it is likely the black-haired boy told the army enough for them to be on alert.<br>This will doubtless be the most difficult of fights.<br>At last, they arrive at a ladder leading to the surface.<br>The young man turns to his allies and speaks in a heavy tone.<br>He tells them there is one thing he has to do before<br>killing the person responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>He must find the boy who vanished after<br>leaving proof of his betrayal and ask him <i>why</i>.<br>The young man continues:<br>"If he really was communicating with the enemy,<br>he wouldn’t have left proof for us to find."<br>"I saw in his eyes how much he hated our enemy. None of that was false."<br>Even now, he trusts the black-haired boy.<br>For he is just as reckless as the young man used to be.<br>The young man knows his request to find the boy<br>is selfish; they don't even know if he is in the facility at all.<br>"Anyway, I won't ask any of you come with me,"<br>concludes the young man as he casts his gaze downward.<br>The rest of his group chuckles.<br>"We've always known how selfish you are,<br>yet we chose to stick by your side.<br>We burn with the same need for revenge as you,<br>yet we also know the boy wouldn't betray us without some reason."<br>These are their words.<br>While the need for revenge may be the warped strand<br>that keeps their group together, they also have a firm bond of trust.<br>"Thank you," says the young man.<br>Together, they climb the ladder and move into the base.<br>The group had steeled themselves for a battle against<br>uncountable enemy soldiers, but security is unnaturally lax.<br>"They'll be here any second! Send out the patrols and ready for a counterattack!"<br>Hearing enemy soldiers yelling orders, the group freezes in place and attempts to<br>get a better idea of what is happening. But...<br>"Intruders! Intru—"<br>The guard's voice suddenly cuts off of amidst a burst of gunfire.<br>The group has no idea what is happening, which makes the situation<br>all the more dangerous. Yet they have no choice but to take advantage of the chaos and act.<br>They carve a path with blade and bullet,<br>proceeding through the base in search of the black-haired boy.<br>Their destination is the control room, where the young man feels certain he will be found.<br>His trust in the boy has not wavered; not even when presented with proof of his betrayal.<br>His heart is bound not by logic, but by faith, and it now tells him where to go.<br>And then...<br>As the group nears the control room, their eyes widen at the terrible sight before them.<br>Bodies of dead soldiers lie scattered across the quiet hallway.<br>Bullet holes scar the walls around them.<br>The young man has an awful feeling in his gut. His heart pounds in his ears.<br>He takes a moment to calm his breathing, then begins to follow the trail of blood.<br>Silence hangs heavily around them.<br>Not a single guard stands watch outside the control room—the place where<br>the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy should be.<br>At a wordless signal from the young man, his companions batter down the door.<br>But...<br>The room is silent. There is no sign of the enemy leader they are looking for.<br>Instead, there is someone else lying on the floor.<br>His black hair is matted with blood. Breath rattles in his chest as life slowly abandons him.<br>The young man's eyes widen.<br>As one, the group breaks into a dash and rushes over to the boy.<br>"H-hey, boss..."<br>The corner of the boy's mouth, thick with blood, quirks upward in a half-smile.<br>The young man crouches down and tells him not to speak. As he inspects his wounds,<br>his mind whirls, wondering if there is a way to save him.<br>But his body is riddled with bullets; everyone can see his time is nearly gone.<br>The boy croaks out a hoarse voice, apologizing for his actions before attempting to explain.<br>The enemy had approached him, offering to put him in<br>contact with his real parents if he turned traitor.<br>But when the army invaded the destitute district and began<br>slaughtering people indiscriminately, he immediately regretted his decision.<br>So he turned his coat again, using his position as their mole to infiltrate the<br>facility and kill the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. It...did not go well.<br>As the young man listens to this tale of regret, a thought comes to him:<br>Perhaps they should not forgive the boy for divulging information to the enemy.<br>But...<br>Would he have done differently in his place? The young man is not so sure.<br>Can he blame the boy for being led astray because of a desire to find happiness with his family?<br>"It's fine," says the young man. "Don't worry. I'll finish the job."<br>"Thanks... And maybe one day..."<br>A melancholy smile spreads across the black-haired boy's face.<br>"You can tell me what comes after revenge..."<br>His words stop. He lies still.<br>The young man watches as his life ends, then quietly gets to his feet.<br>They must keep going. Vengeance will not wait.<br>The boy has killed the guards and plunged the facility into chaos.<br>They cannot waste this opportunity.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The black-haired boy infiltrated the military facility as a mole.<br>But after pretending to serve them, he bore his fangs and killed countless guards,<br>causing chaos to descend upon the facility.<br>And though he ultimately perished...<br>His compatriots and allies followed the path he carved and successfully<br>reached the core of the facility.<br>Now, they continue searching for the man<br>responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>An inhumane project wherein the country kidnaps children from<br>neighboring lands to raise as either soldiers or laborers.<br>The boy and his companions are victims of this operation,<br>and their goal is to kill this man and get their revenge.<br>Dawn approaches.<br>At the gate behind the facility, several shadowy figures mill about in the dark.<br>"Why aren't the damned reinforcements here yet!?"<br>The man who cursed wears a uniform decorated with several medals.<br>He is the person responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy,<br>and he now runs a nervous hand through his long beard.<br>Unable to hide his irritation in the face of his guards' failure,<br>he is resorting to chewing out his subordinates.<br>"The reinforcements will be here in less than ten minutes, sir,"<br>one of his personal retinue tells him.<br>He gestures to a waiting car, inviting the man inside.<br>They will ferry him away to a safe place until the commotion dies down.<br>But...<br>Gunshots ring out.<br>Bullets pierce the guards' heads, sending blood flying.<br>The man realizes what is going on, but by the time<br>he attempts to make his escape, it is far too late.<br>The thin blade of a rapier suddenly pierces his neck from behind,<br>its steel shimmering in the pale light of night.<br>The man feels cold spreading across his body,<br>as well as fear of his upcoming demise.<br>Suddenly, the voice of a young man whispers low in his ear:<br>"You have no right to mourn your death; my friends all<br>faced more gruesome ends because of you."<br>He then begins to speak of all of the lives he's seen<br>ruined because of the Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>The children who grew into soldiers, forever ignorant of their pasts.<br>Those children locked in dark, cramped rooms<br>and forced to labor until their last breath.<br>And those who learned of the top-secret operation and met their ends as a result.<br>As the boy quakes with fury, the man attempts to articulate an apology.<br>But the boy cuts him off.<br>"Not to me. Apologize to the dead."<br>And with that, the man's light goes out forever.<br>The young man has found his revenge, but in so doing has lost his path home.<br>The rest of his allies had volunteered to hold off the enemy and catch up later,<br>granting the young man a path to vengeance.<br>But none of them have arrived. Instead, all that follows the young<br>man as he flees are reinforcements sent by the military.<br>Several hours have passed since he escaped the facility.<br>The sky lightens, the sun gradually starting to show its face.<br>Though the young man hid every time he encountered the enemy,<br>he has taken numerous bullets, and his body now nears its end.<br>He rests on his knees, alone in the shade of a building. The blood<br>that flees his body reddens the ground as it greets the dawn.<br>As the young man sits beneath the rising sun, he feels his consciousness fade.<br>And yet, he does not mind such an end.<br>His revenge is complete.<br>It is all over.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>"I'm glad you survived."<br>There comes a voice from the darkness.<br>It is an old voice, one he heard many times in the past,<br>and one that comes with many memories.<br>It is then he realizes:<br>Though he cannot move and his vision is clouding, he still <i>lives</i>.<br>Off in the distance, he sees a small light.<br>In the light, people wave.<br>They are...<br>His parents: the ones who raised him, despite being part of a plot.<br>His real father: the one he killed with his own hands.<br>His real mother: the one who brought him into this world.<br>His squadmates: the ones for whom he caused so much trouble,<br>yet who forgave him all the same.<br>His compatriots: the ones who believed in him and led him to this point.<br>It is then that he remembers.<br><i>We need you to live.</i><br>His allies had risked their lives to ensure his survival.<br>He cannot forget this.<br>They have entrusted so much to his care, and he has somehow survived this long.<br>And...<br><i>Maybe one day, you can tell me what comes after revenge...</i><br>He must fulfill his promise to the black-haired boy.<br>And that<br>is why<br>he can't<br>die just yet.<br>But...<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>Earlier this summer, fifteen boys launched a revolt against a military facility.<br>Their objective was to kill the man behind the Infant Abduction Strategy.<br>And while they accomplished their objective, reports claim they paid for it with their lives.<br>The Infant Abduction Strategy was the military's best-kept secret—its existence<br>unknown to all but a few in power—and they attempted to clean it up in secret.<br>However, one soldier blew the whistle on the inhumane<br>methods of the operation, and was quickly labeled a hero.<br>As a result, the vice-like grip the military once held over the government is now in decline.<br>And now...<br>A lonely young man walks atop an abandoned railroad,<br>flanked on either side by rows of sunflowers.<br>His body is scarred with signs of battle; he had once been so<br>consumed by vengeance that he became a soldier.<br>He is the one who led the revolt.<br>Reports claim all the children involved in the incident had perished.<br>But he alone had been saved by a hero. He alone survived.<br>He walks along the old railroad.<br>He walks by himself, no blade or pistol at his hip, in search of what comes after revenge.<br>This is his path.<br>Summer is coming to an end.<br>A cool breeze dances among the flowers.<br>As though gently encouraging him forward.</p>
