<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A teacher's monotone voice drones on in the late afternoon heat.<br>Another joyous summer vacation has come to an end.<br>And for the children now set free of its grip, math class is <i>impossibly</i> dull.<br><br>A boy sits near the window, head drooped in gloom as his pencil travels lazy circles across the page.<br><br>The students around him are loud despite class being in session. They pass notes. Talk to each other.<br><br>Beads of sweat drop from the boy's forehead. Irritated,<br>he musters his courage and turns to his classmates.<br>"Be quiet".<br><br>But the mischievous children pay his order no mind.<br><br>Instead, they make fun of him, exchanging glances and giggles.<br><br>The boy bites his lip and hides his hands under the desk,<br>his fingers moving over an object that is not there.<br>He pretends to hold the controller of a game console.<br>He uses this trick to calm himself whenever something unpleasant is happening.<br><br>First, he pictures the character selection screen.<br><br>He always chooses to play as Levania.<br><br>Levania is the name of a character in his action game—one who looks the part of a gallant hero.<br><br>Only when Levania is slaughtering enemies in a dungeon<br>does the boy feel any sense of power in his own life.<br>He feel the possibility of becoming a hero.<br><br>Of his classmates ceasing their endless taunts.<br><br>For the boy, playing as Levania is the only time he ever feels peace.<br<br>>The bell rings, signaling the end of the day.<br><br>Orange light pours through the halls as gaggles of children race by with heavy packs upon their backs.<br>The building is filled with the clamor of their voices.<br><br>As they talk and laugh about various after-school plans, the boy drags his feet, alone.<br><br>Suddenly, other boys from his class come rushing down the hall behind him.<br><br>As they are about to pass, they slam into him,<br>catching the Levania keychain dangling from his backpack on a bag of their own.<br><br>The boy is spun around and sent crashing to the floor.<br><br>He lifts his head in disgust.<br>The classmate that ran into him glances down, but offers no word of apology or concern.<br><br>Instead, he laughs and rushes away to join his friends.<br><br>"Are you okay?"<br><br>The voice belongs to a girl from his class⁠—one who has seen the entire event transpire.<br>She rushes over to him with concern on her features.<br><br>But the boy ignores her as he climbs to his feet.<br><br>She is a good student with excellent grades and a bright, cheerful personality.<br>The teachers love her, as do the other students.<br>She inhabits her own perfect world, far away from scorn or question.<br>The complete opposite of the boy.<br><br>And her worry only makes him more miserable.<br><br>He quietly moves to leave.<br>But⁠ then...<br><br>"Oh! Levania!"<br><br>The boy freezes.<br><br>The girl reaches out to touch the Levania keychain on his backpack, her wide eyes glimmering.<br><br>When he realizes she knows his game—perhaps even <i>enjoys</i> it—the<br>wariness with which he shields himself suddenly melts away.<br><br>"I'm home, says the boy quietly."<br><br>The rusty apartment door creaks open.<br><br>He slips off his shoes and steps into the house, followed by the cheerful girl.<br><br>The Levania keychain has proven a way for them to connect with one another.<br>After the girl proposed they play the game together, they both headed back to the boy's abode.<br><br>The apartment is quiet as death.<br>The boy's father works from early morning until late into the night, while his mother is in the hospital.<br>The home is empty save for the two children.<br><br>The boy flips on the game console.<br><br>He attaches two controllers and hands one to the girl.<br><br>When the character select screen appears, the boy chooses Levania, as always.<br>But the girl?<br><br>The girl chooses the monster.<br>It is a horrifying, eyeless creature clad in black armor and sprouting hideous insect wings.<br><br>It has no name. No identity. It is simply called "the monster."<br><br>"You really want to play as the monster? asks the boy."<br><br>He thinks perhaps she chose her character by mistake.<br><br>But the girl simply nods once and presses the start button.<br><br>"Wow. I've never met anyone who mains the monster."<br><br>"Really? I love Mr. Monster. He's so strong."<br><br>The boy hums. This is unexpected.<br<br>>He assumed she would pick the hero. Or the knight. Or the princess. And yet...<br><br>Tense music drifts through the dusty apartment.<br>The afternoon sun is hot; the girl occasionally wipes sweat away from her brow with her long sleeves.<br><br>Together, hero and monster—their characters—proceed through a cave.<br><br>They must defeat all the enemies in the dungeon to complete the game.<br><br>As the screen flickers and a battle begins, they both grip their controllers tightly.<br><br>The boy's character, Levania, swiftly cuts down all of his foes.<br><br>Beside him, the girl's character—the monster—writhes and rampages,<br>obliterating its enemies in the most violent of ways.<br><br>The girl presses buttons with wild abandon.<br><br>She does not play with strategy.<br>She cares not a whit for the story or the adventure of the thing. She plays purely by instinct.<br><br>After a few moments, the boy stops.<br>His gaze shifts to look at the girl.<br><br>Her expression is frozen, her eyes transfixed as she slaughters her enemies one after the next.<br><br>The game on the screen is the same one he has long enjoyed.<br>But the girl's frenzied way of playing is something wholly unfamiliar.<br><br>The screen is soaked in crimson.<br>Wet chunks of flesh and viscera fly.<br>The eerie battle cry of the monster causes unease to stir in the boy's heart.<br><br>It is a terrible sight—one that could be either reality or fantasy.<br><br>The sky grows dark. The sun sets.<br><br>But the girl pays no mind to her curfew, instead focusing all that she is on the game in front of her.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The bell rings, signaling the start of the midday break.<br>The moment it sounds, classmates swarm the boy's desk by the window.<br>The tallest among them takes a step forward, peering at the boy's drooping face.<br>The tall boy is known for being bossy and tyrannical, essentially ruling over the grade⁠ as their king.<br>He has brought several other students to the boy, causing him to tense in his seat.<br>"I heard about you," says the king.<br>A grin oozes across his face as he begins.<br>"You're good at games, right?"<br>"Uh, what?"<br>The boy looks up, surprised.<br>"That's what she told me," says the king,<br>waving to the girl sitting on the other side of the room. "Isn't that right?"<br>Sure is, the smiling girl chimes in.<br>She and the boy had hit it off the moment they discovered their shared hobby.<br>Every day since, they visited the boy's house after school to play the game.<br>And unbeknownst to him, she has begun spreading word of his skill to the rest of the students.<br>His classmates marvel as he tells them how to clear dungeons.<br>It is the boy's first time having anyone actually <i>listen</i> to him.<br>And though it's embarrassing, it's not nearly as bad as he long feared it might be.<br>From that day forward, the boy's life changes.<br>School transforms from a march of drudgery to something he actually enjoys.<br>The summer heat that enveloped the boy and girl when they first met fades into autumn,<br>and eventually the calendar on the classroom wall flips to an illustration of a snowman.<br>This morning begins as they all do.<br>The homeroom teacher calls out names as he takes attendance.<br>As the boy rubs his hands together against the cold,<br>his eyes drift to the girl's seat on the opposite side of the room⁠. The girl's <i>empty</i> seat.<br>Her grades are impeccable. Her absences few.<br>He cannot remember the last time she didn't attend class.<br><i>Guess we won't be playing today,</i> the boy thinks to himself.<br>A voice comes as the boy's gaze drops in sadness.<br>It belongs to another girl who sits next to him.<br>"Did you hear the news?<br>She was arrested for shoplifting."<br>"Shoplifting?"<br>The boy blurts out the word in spite of himself.<br>The girl is so cheerful. So kind. So capable. Everyone likes her.<br>The idea she might engage in a criminal activity boggles his mind.<br>"Yeah, apparently they caught her stealing bread or something?<br>And when they questioned her, they found out all the games she owns were ALSO stolen!"<br>The boy falls into dumbfounded shock. He honestly cannot believe what he is hearing.<br>He then thinks of how she acts whenever they play together.<br>How quiet she is when she controls the ferocious monster.<br>How silent she sits as she slaughters foes without mercy.<br>The boy returns home and flicks on his console; it has been a long time since he played by himself.<br>With his father at work and his mother in the hospital,<br>the girl was his lone balm against the pain of loneliness.<br>But she is not here today. There is only him, the game, and the screen.<br>As the game flickers to life, he chooses the hero Levania for himself.<br>He then begins to play, losing himself in the action until well after sunset.<br>Suddenly, the doorbell rings.<br>The boy looks out the peephole and sees the girl.<br>She seems paler than usual, but still smiles at him through the glass.<br>Wordlessly the boy invites her in and they begin to play.<br>Hero and monster⁠ mow down foes together.<br>But the silence between the players is awkward.<br>Finally, the boy sharply inhales and turns to his friend.<br>"Is it true? What I heard about you, I mean?"<br>The rumors at school.<br>Stolen bread. Stolen games.<br>Was it true. <i>Could</i> it be?<br>His question is hesitant, as is the reply.<br>"...Yeah. It's true."<br>With a faint voice, the girl admits her guilt.<br>"My mom... She won't buy me anything."<br>A new battle begins on the screen.<br>The girl's thumbs fly across the controller.<br><i>Crunch crunch crunch.</i><br>She slaughters foes with perfect precision.<br>Chunks of flesh cruelly ripped away dye the screen red.<br>The crimson screen illuminates her face, showing a faint smile as she enacts her massacre.<br>And between gaps in her sleeves, the boy catches glimpses of skin covered in bruises.<br>He always thought it strange⁠ that she wore long-sleeved shirts at all times.<br>Even in the hot summer. Even in gym class.<br>Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew she was hiding something,<br>but a terrible feeling in his gut convinced him not to think about it.<br>So he always looked away from the occasional glimpses of skin beneath her hems.<br>But now, he must face it.<br>She wears long sleeves to hide her bruises. Bruises that have been given to her by...<br>The girl smiles every time the monster's claws and fangs rend her enemies.<br>A moment later, the game informs them they've completed their mission.<br>She stares at the screen, making a small, satisfied sigh.<br>"Isn't Mr. Monster great?"<br>Her voice is hoarse. Her smile fades.<br>"I wish I could be just as strong as him. I wish I could destroy everything."<br>Her eyes curse the very world as they fixate on the screen.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Once again, the boy's classmates gather around his desk by the window.<br>They excitedly chat amongst themselves whenever the boy brings up strategies for games.<br>As he speaks, his gaze drifts to the seat on the opposite side of the classroom.<br>The girl sits alone, her head low.<br>Once, the boy had no place at home or school. But after meeting the girl, his life drastically changed.<br>Every day, they played video games in his room.<br>And once the girl learned of his talent for it, word spread among his classmates.<br>This is how the boy who was once an outcast suddenly became popular.<br>But the girl, on the other hand...<br>She has lost her place; switched positions with the boy.<br>One week prior, she stole bread from a shop, an act which brought to light a whole string of other thefts.<br>And though she has resumed coming to school, everyone now regards her coldly.<br>Just a week prior, she had been considered an exemplary student. But such times are gone now.<br>And yet, once school is over, the girl comes to the boy's house so they might resume their play.<br>She controls her terrifying monster with a smile.<br>By destroying everything in the game—violently,<br>viscerally—she relieves herself of her daily resentment.<br>All while bruises peek from the sleeves on her arms.<br>When the boy's father returns from work, gloom returns to girl's face as she departs.<br>Now alone in his room, the boy stands and thinks.<br><i>There must be a reason why she did what she did.</i><br>She'd said her mother buys nothing for her, not even food.<br>Add to that to the wounds beneath her clothes, and there is no doubt the girl is in a terrible situation.<br>"I wish I could be just as strong as him. I wish I could destroy everything."<br>The boy recalls what she said: how she wanted to be the monster.<br><i>I want to help her.</i><br>Her friendship is the only reason his life has turned around.<br>And now it is his turn to help her.<br>He cannot stand by and do nothing. So once the boy knows his father is asleep,<br>he slips out into the nighttime city alone.<br>Garbage is piled everywhere.<br>White fluorescent light illuminates a room so disorganized that there is no path to walk.<br>In the corner, the girl huddles against a wall, attending to her homework.<br>A woman languidly nurses a drink beside her⁠: her mother.<br>The room reeks of alcohol. Sadness. Regret.<br>When the girl coughs softly, the woman glares daggers.<br><i>She's going to hit me</i>,<br>thinks the girl as she cowers instinctively from the blow she is sure will come.<br>But then, the bell rings.<br>The woman clicks her tongue and glares at the door. Who could be visiting so late at night?<br>She decides to ignore it.<br>But it rings again.<br>And again. And again. And again.<br>Unable to bear the noise, the woman flings the door wide.<br>Only to find the boy standing in the doorway.<br>Vexed, the woman narrows her eyes at him. Why has a child come to her house so late at night?<br>A moment later, the blood drains from her face.<br>For the boy carries a metal pipe in his hand.<br>Before her stands a child—his voice likely still unchanged. Yet with such a weapon,<br>even a child could very well have the strength to kill.<br>The woman takes a trembling step back.<br>The boy raises the pipe in an attempt to intimidate,<br>stepping on garbage as he follows her deeper into the room.<br>When he finally locates the dazed girl in the corner, he hurries to her side.<br>"Come on," he says. "Let's go."<br>He extends his hand.<br>"We'll be like the monster. We'll destroy <i>everything.</i>"<br>She looks up in surprise for a moment—but only a moment.<br>Seconds later, a small smile crosses her face.<br>Together, they dash out into the midnight city.<br>Whenever they find something they don't like, they smash it with their pipes.<br>The car the girl's mother uses to bring mean people to their home.<br>The sign for the store that disparaged the girl for stealing bread.<br>The windows of the school, a place ruled by useless teachers<br>who did not even realize she needed help.<br>The girl destroys everything she hates, then gazes upon it and laughs wildly.<br>But it is not enough.<br>She lends herself to impulse, swinging her pipe at all she sees.<br>When the boy rolls up on a bicycle he found parked by the side of the road,<br>the girl leaps on behind him.<br>And then, they fly. The nighttime wind cools their feverish skin, and they scream in delight.<br>After pedaling for a long time, the pair eventually comes across a road they do not know.<br>"I think we'll see the ocean soon!" cries the boy.<br>But the moment he speaks...<br>The sound of a siren tears a hole in the night.<br>A red light flashes atop the car that rounds the corner, illuminating the pair in crimson light.<br>The boy's face pales; he knows the occupants of the car mean to arrest them.<br><i>We need to get out of here.</i><br>If they are brought back, the girl will only find more suffering at the hands of adults.<br>The boy pedals with all that he is.<br>But a child on a bicycle has no hopes of outrunning a car.<br>Before long, they are corralled into a dead end.<br>There is nowhere left to run.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The boy's father works from dawn to dusk.<br>His mother is ill in the hospital. He has no parents. No friends.<br>But his gloomy life changes the day he meets the girl.<br>They hit it off over a shared love of a video game—one they begin to play every day.<br>The girl is a star pupil with a bright personality, liked by all.<br>Yet when a series of thefts come to light, the boy learns the true circumstances of her life.<br>Her mother abuses her to the point where she must steal her own food to survive.<br>Hoping to save her, the boy breaks into the girl's home and steals her away.<br>The race through the nocturne city, smashing everything with metal pipes.<br>The travel a seemingly impossible distance in the space of a single night.<br>They thought they were almost near the ocean—a distance far enough<br>away they would only ever see it on a field trip.<br>But when the adults catch them and throw them in the police car, understanding dawns:<br>They had not come far at all.<br>The car returns to the city in no time.<br>Adults pepper the boy and the girl with questions.<br>They ask why two children were playing so late at night. Why they were breaking so many things.<br>And though the adults appear sympathetic when they learn of the girl's plight,<br>this does not make them kind.<br>Instead, they only double down on their scolding.<br>When their teachers hear of it, they scold. When the boy's father hears of it, he scolds.<br>Part of the boy knows he deserves it; he ran through the city smashing things, after all.<br>And yet, frustration weighs heavy on his heart.<br>None of them understand him. None of them understand the girl.<br>But life goes on.<br>Though they attend school, no one speaks to them.<br>Once his classmates find out what he did, the boy becomes a pariah.<br>It is a familiar sort of existence, one he settles into easily.<br>Days pass. Winter vacation approaches.<br>The final homeroom of the day begins.<br>But then, a surprise: The homeroom teacher calls the girl up to the front of the class.<br>She stands before the blackboard, eyes fixed on the floor.<br>The boy has a terrible feeling, and his already frayed nerves begin to split even further.<br>The teacher announces that the girl will be transferring schools.<br>In that moment, the boy's world goes dark.<br>The bell rings, signaling the end of the school day.<br>The children bid goodbye to each other.<br>It's all so, <i>so</i> far away.<br>When the teacher and students leave, the boy remains in his seat.<br>Across the room, the girl waits in her own.<br>The boy sits by the wall with the windows; the girl by the wall against the corridor.<br>They are alone in in a cold, dark silence.<br>"I'm sorry."<br>The girl breaks the still first.<br>From her distant seat, she slowly explains.<br>After the incident, relatives learned her mother was abusing her and decided to take her in.<br>She is going to live in a city far away from her mother—and from the boy.<br>But the boy suppresses the swell of emptiness surging inside him and says:<br>"Good. I'm glad."<br>And he <i>is</i> glad, because now she can live a life without pain.<br>She no longer needs to steal. She no longer has to suffer at the hands of her mother.<br>But the girl feels differently.<br>"I wish...we could have run away together."<br>Her voice is a whisper.<br>She does not want to move. Because once she does,<br>it will mean the end of their time playing games together.<br>Deep down, they are of the same heart. Yet the boy knows there is nothing he can do in this situation.<br>They are children; they lack the power to go where they please.<br>The apartment is dark and cold.<br>Light from the TV screen casts the boy's shadow across the floor.<br>He plays alone.<br>On the screen, the monster rages.<br>Though the boy once always played the hero, he now chooses the role of monster.<br>The girl's favorite⁠ character. Her inspiration to grow stronger—and to destroy everything.<br>Sounds of slaughter burst from the speakers.<br>It gives him strange comfort.<br>He closes his eyes and imagines.<br>And now...<br>He stands in a darkened nighttime street.<br>But he is no longer human. He is the monster.<br>He has the power to destroy.<br>The boy⁠ wails. The <i>monster</i> wails.<br>Its voice causes the ground to shudder, rendering all to dust.<br>The school. His apartment.<br>Park fences. Cars.<br>Street signs. Distant buildings.<br>Everything he can see. Everything. <i>Everything.</i><br>His scream destroys it all.<br>One after another, the lights in the city wink out.<br>Splatters of blood splash across the sky as the monster roars and roars and roars.<br>Bricks dance in the air, creating a storm.<br>The overflowing river swallows the city entire.<br>He takes everything in this world and destroys it.<br>Everything but himself and the girl.<br>When his screams have ruined all, this planet is rendered into nothing.<br>The monster leaps into the air.<br>His unsightly wings flap, carrying him across the ruined earth below.<br>And amidst the starlit wastelands, he finds the person he is looking for.<br>The girl is waiting for her monster with a smile.<br>Thus does he dream.<br>Alone in his dark room, thus does he pray.<br><i>If I am ever reborn, I want to be a powerful creature like the monster.</i><br><i>I want the strength to save the people that matter to me.</i></p>
