<p class="title">Chapter 1: Memories (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">I breathe in the dusty air of the arcade. Synthesized sound<br>pulses from tiny speakers on the cabinet. The display before<br>me gives a colorful flicker, and the game begins. <br><br>A musical note appears on the screen, along with a blast of<br>song. I being to dance, stomping my feet on the correct<br>panels in time with the symbol. I concentrate on the game<br>as my feet fly, riding the waves of the synthesizer with my<br>entire being. I forget everything happening at home.<br>Everything that happened at school. I <i>dance</i>. <br><br>When the music comes to an end. I pause to catch my breath.<br>Fervor seeps from my body, quickly pulling back to reality.<br>The screen shows the score for a player whose username is<br>"LEVANIA." It isn't a bad score, but no one competes against<br>me anymore; there are only a handful of arcades now that even<br>have outdated games like this, much less people who want to<br>play them.<br><br>My gaze darts to the corner, where a cabinet of the same<br>game sits dark and alone. They used to rest side-by-side<br>so people could play and compete for a high score together.<br>But now it's covered in dust. Like a stone. Like a grave.<br><br>A long time ago, Mom would have been on the other machine. <br><br>When I was much younger, I'd often dance with Mom after my<br>afternoon lessons. She was awkward in general—and especially<br>terrible at dancing—and we'd always laugh when she stumbled.<br>It was a good way to pass the time while we waited for Dad<br>to pick us up in the car.<br><br>But she isn't around anymore. Six months ago, the illness<br>that had been plaguing her for years finally set her free. <br><br>I stand there and space out, letting a flood of images roll<br>through my mind. Eventually, a staff member comes and<br>tells to go home; city law states that anyone under the age<br>of 20 needs to leave the arcades by six. Nodding, I grab my<br>school bag and head out.<br><br>Dad's there when I get back to the apartment. He usually<br>works late into the night, so it's unusual to see him home.<br><br>"Welcome back!" he calls out as he busies himself preparing<br>dinner in our cramped kitchen.<br><br>"Tell me if you're gonna be home early," I say—and in case<br>my annoyance isn't clear, I slam my shopping bag on the<br>table with a loud thud. "I wouldn't have gone out of my way<br>to buy dinner if I knew you'd be making something."<br><br>"You were at the arcade," says Dad, conveniently ignoring<br>my annoyance. "Your teacher said you're not allowed to go<br>there after school anymore, remember?" <br><br>I ignore him and go to the portrait of Mom sitting in the<br>corner. I close my eyes and begin to speak, telling her<br>everything I did today. It's something I do every evening,<br>but this time, I barely get started before Dad interrupts.<br><br>"Are you listening to me? This is for your sake, you know.<br>Your mother would be worried too." <br><br>"Shut up when I'm talking to her!" I snap without opening<br>my eyes. He doesn't know anything about me. All he does<br>is nag, and every little thing he says is irritating.<br><br>Why did this have to happen? We got along so well<br>back when Mom was alive. <br><br><i>Hey, Mom. Everyone's annoying me. Dad. The people at school.<br>Everybody. I wish they'd all just go to sleep forever.</i><br><br>A loud thud cases my eyes to snap open. I whip my head<br>around toward the kitchen and see Dad sprawled across the<br>floor. Even though he'd been nagging me just moments<br>before, he now lies there in silence—no matter how many<br>times I scream his name.<br><br>                  ＊          ＊          ＊<br><br>They take Dad to the hospital. The doctors say he's fine.<br>Just...asleep. But that doesn't make me feel even a little<br>bit better. I know about the sleeping sickness that's been<br>causing panic across the city lately. People fall asleep,<br>even though there's nothing particularly wrong with them. <br><br>They never wake up.<br><br>There's no cure.<br><br>And now Dad has it.<br><br>I visit him in the hospital the next day after school.<br>I know nothing will have changed—he'll still just be<br>sleeping—but I can't leave him there alone. <br><br>The hall smells of medicine as I make my way down the<br>hall to his room. The setting rays of the sun pour in,<br>filling it with an ashy light. But when I get to the door,<br>I see Dad standing next to his bed.<br><br>He's awake. He's <i>awake</i>.<br><br>I call out to him, my voice a mixture of shock and joy and<br>nerves. But as the words dissipate in the air, I realize<br>something is very, very wrong.<br><br>"...Dad?"<br><br>He's facing the wall, a pen in his hand. He's scribbling on<br>them over and over. Turning them black. Like a child might. <br><br>When I look closer, I realize the mass of black looks like<br>the kind of monster I'd see in games back when I was a kid.<br>A dark monster that resembles nothing more than a mass of<br>thick, wiry hair. <br><br>This isn't normal. Scribbling on walls isn't <i>normal</i>.<br>But no matter how many times I call out, he never replies. <br><br>That's when I realize his eyes are closed. He's still<br>asleep, dreaming some unknowable thing as he scribbles<br>darkness onto the white hospital walls.<br><br>Creating monsters.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: City in Daydreams (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">Two weeks ago, Dad caught the disease that's been ravaging<br>the city. It's called "the sleeping sickness," and people<br>who get it suddenly fall asleep and never wake up again.<br>No one knows what causes it—or how to treat it. And since<br>my mom died six months ago, I suddenly found myself alone.<br>But a few relatives reached out to help, so I kept going to<br>school like a normal kid—except that I ended every day by<br>visiting my father in a hospital.<br><br>But one day, I found him out of bed and scribbling a<br>picture of a monster on the wall—even though he was still<br>asleep. The doctors said they wanted to keep the drawing<br>"for research," so now I have to look at this black,<br>horrible creature every day when I visit.<br><br>And I feel like it's <i>watching</i> me.<br><br>                  ＊          ＊          ＊<br><br>I hear the other students singing off in the music room.<br>There's a school-wide choir competition next month, and all<br>the classes are practicing for their part. But I'm not singing—<br>instead, I'm standing outside as my class president<br>and his lackeys pelt me with questions.<br><br>"Why didn't you come to practice yesterday?"<br><br>I tell him I skipped practice to see my dad, but they don't<br>care. Other kids have parents with the sleeping sickness,<br>and apparently <i>they're</i> still willing to come sing a<br>bunch of stupid songs, so I should just suck it up.<br><br>It's all BS. My mom is dead, and my dad is apparently going<br>to sleep until he dies too. I'm unhappy enough at home;<br>I sure as hell don't need people giving me grief at school.<br><br>As the class president continues to berate me, I close<br>my eyes and scream inside my mind as loud as I can:<br><br><i>I WISH YOU'D ALL JUST SLEEP FOREVER!</i><br><br>There's a loud thud, then two more. When I open my eyes,<br>the class president and his goons lying on the floor—<br>the same way Dad did two weeks ago when he collapsed.<br><br>But then it gets worse. <i>Way</i> worse. Like someone<br>pressed a switch, a continuous series of thuds and crashes<br>ring out as people start dropping all around me. Students<br>walking the halls. Teachers lecturing at blackboards.<br>The janitor and his mop. Even the sounds of singing<br>suddenly cut off, replaced by a cacophony of thumps<br>as bodies meet earth.<br><br>I start running through the halls in a panic. Everyone is<br>asleep. <i>Everyone</i>. The entire school has apparently<br>caught the sleeping sickness at the exact same time. I run<br>to the office and pick up the phone to call for help, but<br>no one answers. Not the hospital. Not the police. No one.<br><br>Shaking, I run down the hall and burst out the door into a<br>completely silent city. Everyone is down. Old people out<br>shopping. Men and women in business suits. Kids. As far as<br>I can tell, I'm the only person awake in the entire world.<br><br>I wander the city in a daze; it feels like walking through a<br>weird, dark forest. With no idea what to do, I make my way<br>to the shopping center, figuring there<br>has to be <i>someone</i> who's<br>still awake. And the moment I passed through the district<br>arch, I see a tall, thin shadow at the end of the street. <br><br><i>Someone's awake!</i> I think as I start waving frantically.<br>But then my arm slows and slowly drops to my side as I take<br>a single step backward. <br><br>Because the thing at the end of the street isn't a person.<br><br>It's a <i>monster</i>.<br><br>It looks a lot like the character in a game I used to play—<br>and exactly like the thing Dad drew on the wall.<br><br>I have to be dreaming. This <i>can't</i> be real. I look<br>down for a second to clear my head, then look up again.<br><br>The monster is still there.<br><br>And then it sees me. <br><br>The moment I catch its attention, it trills a pair of huge<br>insect wings and rushes toward me. I should run. I should<br>scream. But fear is my entire world, and my body has decided<br>that shutting down is the best thing to do right now.<br><br>The monster lurches to a halt in front of me, staring down<br>at my shaking, quivering form.<br><br>And then? It talks.<br><br>"I want to...eat dreams... I ate...everyone else's...<br>I want to eat your dreams." <br><br>Its voice is coarse, like vocal cords being scraped over<br>a cheese grater, but I can still understand the horrible<br>things it's saying.<br><br>"M-my dreams?" I whisper.<br><br>"Your dreams. All dreams. When I eat all dreams,<br>I will become human."<br><br>My body finally decides to let me have a modicum of control,<br>and I take a step back, trying to put distance between us.<br>But then, a thought appears in my head:<br><br><i>The monster said it eats dreams. Is that why everyone is<br>asleep? Is this thing the reason for the sleeping sickness?</i><br><br>It's an insane idea, and I wonder briefly if thinking it<br>means I've lost my mind. But then I remember there's a<br><i>monster</i> standing in front of me, and figure concepts like<br>"sanity" have probably gone right out the window. <br><br>"Um, is no one's waking up because you ate their dreams?" <br><br>I'm clinging to this idea fiercely now, because if the<br>monster caused everyone to fall asleep, maybe it could<br>reverse the process.<br><br>"...Give them back. Give them BACK!<br><i>GIVE MY DAD'S DREAMS BACK RIGHT NOW!</i>"<br><br>The words come out of me in the loudest voice of my life,<br>and the monster leaps away and begins to run. I don't even<br>hesitate—I run after it, pumping limbs with newfound fury.<br><br>I have to get my dad's dreams back. <br><br>I have to wake him up.<br><br>I <i>have</i> to.<br><br>Because If I don't, my mom—the person that loved him<br>with all her heart—would be devastated.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Unforgettable Visage (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">I run down the eerily quiet main street of the shopping<br>district in pursuit of the monster.<br><br>All my classmates had collapsed into a deep sleep. It was<br>an illness that had been getting a lot of attention in town<br>recently⁠—one where those who fell asleep never reawakened.<br>The same illness that claimed my dad.<br><br>But students weren't the only new victims of the disease.<br><i>Everyone</i> was asleep now. Everyone except for me.<br><br>At the far end of the downtown shopping district, where I'd<br>come in search of other waking people, I'd found a dark<br>monster that looked like it stepped out of a video game.<br>"I ate everyone's dreams," it said, and I was sure that was<br>why everyone was asleep. But when I tried to scare the<br>monster into giving the dreams back, it whirled around and<br>fled. So I gave chase, because I wasn't going to let it<br>escape until it returned Dad's dreams and made him whole.<br><br>I dash down the street, making sure not to step on any of<br>the people sleeping in the middle of the road. Ahead, the<br>monster runs with ferocious speed, occasionally pausing to<br>look back at me, almost like it wants me to follow.<br><br>I eventually enter an run-down building on the outskirts of<br>downtown. With a start, I realize it's the arcade where I<br>used to spend so much of my time. As I follow the monster<br>through a set of broken, sagging doors, the eerie silence<br>of the city falls away, and soon my ears thrum with the<br>noises of arcade machines.<br><br>I make my way forward, searching for the monster. Eventually,<br>I find it standing in the furthest corner of the room, right in<br>front of a darkened and forgotten two-player rhythm game. <br><br>I know this game: It's the one I used to play with Mom when<br>I was a kid. And in the six months since her passing,<br>I'd played it over and over, looking for a shadow of her<br>memory in its brilliant lights. <br><br>Upbeat dance music suddenly blares out of a speaker as the<br>machine springs to life. The monster stares at the neon<br>screen and tilts its head, a human-like gesture without a<br>hint of terror.<br><br>"This game's a lot of fun," I say, speaking to the monster<br>before I even realize what I'm doing. It looks at me, gives<br>a small nod, and timidly reaches out for the screen. But its<br>hands are bulky and awkward, and I realize I'm going to have<br>to take the lead. I drop a pair of coins into the machine—<br>two coins for two players. Then we pick a song from the list.<br>I doubt the monster can understand human music, so I choose<br>for it—a song Mom and I used to play all the time.<br><br>The screen explodes with light as the game begins. Notes fly<br>across the screen in tandem with upbeat music. Our task is<br>to step on the correct panels at our feet, and as I move my<br>body, I feel genuine joy start to bubble up from deep inside<br>me. It's so strange⁠, but even with a <i>monster</i> standing<br>beside me, I'm somehow enjoying myself.<br><br>As I dance, I glance at the neighboring screen. The monster<br>is hesitant, stepping on panels with clumsy, awkward haste. <br><br>"You're so bad at this!" I chuckle. And it's true: The<br>monster is dancing like a clown, and I can't help but laugh.<br><br>The monster makes something like a frown then, and begins<br>moving its feet as quickly as possible. But the harder it<br>concentrates, the more it loses its rhythm, and soon any<br>kind of coordination has gone out the window in favor<br>of flailing arms and legs about wildly.<br><br>As I watch the monster's awkward movements, I feel something<br>well up in my chest⁠: A nostalgic yearning for a time that<br>had slipped away from me so, so long ago. <br><br>The next thing I know, I'm standing in perfect stillness.<br>I've never given up in the middle of a game before, but I<br>can't tear my eyes away from the monster dancing next to me.<br>It's <i>so</i> bad, yet its steps are filled with pure joy—<br>a child suddenly presented with some new and unexpected toy.<br><br>It all reminds me of something. I <i>know</i> these movements.<br>I know who the monster is.<br><br>"...Mom?" <br><br><i>What the hell am I saying?</i> I wonder. I want to laugh<br>and cry at the same time, but I can't help but think of the<br>monster as my mom. I watched her dance like this countless<br>times as a kid, and relived those memories countless times<br>over the past six months.<br><br>The monster stops dancing and turns its eyeless face to me.<br>There's a pause, an eternity filled only with the sounds of<br>unending electronic music. Then the monster opens its mouth<br>and murmurs my name in a dry, scratchy voice.<br><br>The name my mom gave me.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Dancing With You (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Everyone in town was asleep. My dad, the students at school,<br>the people walking down the street⁠—everyone but me. It was<br>all the result of a strange illness that caused people to<br>suddenly fall asleep and never wake up. <br><br>Then a monster appeared before me, one the color of an abyss.<br>It told me it ate everyone's dreams, which I knew was the<br>cause of the illness. Then it ran off to the old arcade<br>where Mom and I used to hang out before she died. We played<br>a dancing rhythm game together, and I suddenly called the<br>monster "Mom." <br><br>And the monster replied with my name. It used my <i>name</i>.<br>The same one mom had given me.<br><br>Now, as I stand here stunned, it repeats my name under its<br>breath over and over again. Like it's trying to remember<br>something—or maybe confirm it. It then slowly walks over to<br>me and reaches out to brush my cheek with a malformed hand.<br><br>"I...want to be human," it says. "I can be human if I eat<br>everyone's dreams. And then I can see you again." <br><br>The monster⁠—my mother—is speaking to me. I can tell she<br>feels terrible for leaving me behind⁠, and I don't blame her.<br>I'm stubborn, impulsive, and terrible with people, and she'd<br>always worried about me. But now, she's returned in the form<br>of a monster. <br><br>I pull my mom into a hug. Even though the armor on her body<br>looks like it would be cold, it holds a human warmth. I'm so<br>happy to see her—and yeah, maybe that happiness is all just<br>a dream, but you know what? I don't care. I just want to<br>stay like this forever. <br><br>But I know Mom will worry even more if I say that out loud,<br>which is why I have to find a way to tell her I can go on.<br><br>"I'm okay, Mom," I whisper. "I'm gonna be fine. But please<br>give everyone's dreams back. Give Dad's dreams back." <br><br>When I say that, Mom wordlessly unwinds me from her arms.<br>The next thing I know, her darkened form emits a soft, faint<br>light that sort of...fades away into the air. Worried that<br>she's about to vanish, my vision starts to blur with tears. <br><br>But to my surprise, Mom's fading hands reach down and select<br>a new song on the arcade machine. Electronic music pulses.<br>Without a word, she begins to stomp her feet on the buttons,<br>her fading body moving with awkward, uninhibited joy. <br><br>She looks over at me. I can't read the expression on her<br>blank monster face, but I can tell she wants me to join her.<br>So I do. We dance together, giving in to childlike glee—just<br>as we did when I was little. And while my heart aches to<br>watch her vanish, that emotion is no match for the<br>exhilaration I feel dancing with her. <br><br>Finally, the music ends. My feet stop. When I turn to look<br>beside me, Mom is gone. There's no trace of the monster.<br><br>I feel like I'm in a dream. But when I look at the score<br>on the screen—a score for two—I know she was here.<br><br> <br>                          ＊          ＊          ＊<br><br><br>When I step out of the arcade, the sleeping people are all<br>sitting up, their eyes wide and bewildered. <br><br>The monster⁠—my mom—has given everyone's dreams back. <br><br>I run to the hospital and discover that Dad is also awake.<br>When I burst into his room, he's busy cleaning up the<br>drawings he'd scribbled on the wall while asleep—drawings<br>of a monster that looks very, <i>very</i> familiar.<br><br>"Kind of creepy I was drawing all this in my sleep," he<br>murmurs. "It reminds me of a fairy tale I once heard—one<br>where people who die are reborn as dream-eating monsters."<br><br>He pauses, embarrassed. He doesn't want to finish the<br>thought and admit that maybe Mom died, become a dream-<br>eating monster, and came to see us.<br><br>But I knew the truth: Mom <i>did</i> become a dream-eating<br>monster and she <i>did</i> come to see us. <br><br>But I don't tell Dad that. I don't tell him tell the truth,<br>because I feel like everything that happened to me is barely<br>hanging on to reality. And if I tell a single person about<br>it, it's going to slip from reality to a dream. So instead<br>of telling him, I join him at the wall and help him clean<br>away the scribbles.<br><br>"I hope you've been keeping your room tidy," he says to me<br>at one point. "You don't get a pass on chores just because<br>I've been in the hospital and couldn't remind you." <br><br>Okay, seriously? Nagging <i>already</i>?<br><br>But this time, I decide not to talk back, because I know<br>Mom will worry if we started fighting. <br><br>I mull everything over in my mind as I watch the monster<br>doodles slow vanish from the walls. I doubt the loneliness<br>I feel from Mom's passing will ever go away. But now I know<br>she lives on as a dream-eating monster somewhere. I know<br>she's watching me from afar. And that's why I have to keep<br>walking. Why I have to keep going forward.<br><br>Because I don't want to worry her anymore.</p>

And she's right—they have no time to stand about.<br>They must restore the warped tales within the memories,<br>collect the weapons, and take back the lost fragments.<br><br>All so they might save that child.</p>
