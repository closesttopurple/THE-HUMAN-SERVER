<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">The shadow of an alien creature flickers against a dirt wall. Deep in a mine that was<br>sealed off centuries ago, he waits in perfect silence. Before him is an ancient dragon—an<br>exceptionally diabolical creature. The dragon notices the intruder and gives a mighty roar that<br>causes the mineshaft to shudder violently. A moment later, its throat begins to glow red with<br>fire. The battle has finally begun. Two hours later...<br><br>MISSION COMPLETE!<br><br>Golden letters flash on the monitor. As the dragon lies motionless on the ground, the adventurers<br>raise their swords and staves high.<br><br>The fanfare is accompanied by a blizzard of dazzling particle effects. Inside a dimly-lit<br>room, the effects reflect off the glasses of a man facing his computer. He is deep into a raid<br>in an MMO. It is an incredibly popular title, with a player base nearing almost one million<br>members. The man and his fellow party members have vanquished the Ancient Dragon—which<br>the most recent patch dropped as the game's newest, most powerful enemy. The group chat<br>is flying with the exclamations of his online friends. Everyone is reveling in their victory.<br><br>nice work all<br>sry I died so many times<br>This was our first time seeing this, so it's okay!!!<br>we won so its fine LOL<br>it was pretty much just Levania taking the stage tho haha<br><br>The man's avatar is an alien creature named Levania. It is, of course, only his character's<br>name—not his own. The man types a message out to the party.<br><br>For me, this isn't a game.<br><br>They retort with their own good-natured jabs.<br><br>YUP there it is! He said it!<br><br>What the man—no, what <i>Levania</i> said—was just an act for his friends. The party has been<br>raiding together for some time, and they have an easy camaraderie among themselves. Theirs<br>is a relationship of inside jokes among informal friends. But everyone knows the man had been<br>the key figure in taking down the dragon. Without him, they likely would not have been victorious.<br><br>As the hands of the clock tick past one in the morning, his friends slowly begin returning<br>to the real world.<br><br>alright I'm out<br>night!<br>i've gotta get up at 6 lol<br>I'm going to bed too!<br>later!<br><br>The man types "See you tomorrow," and logs out. Regardless of how hard he works in the<br>game, reality always claws its way back. The man gleefully crawls into bed and removes his glasses.<br><br>The next morning... The man stands on the train, moving his tired, empty eyes across<br>the crowd packed in around him. <i>I'm sleepy</i>, he thinks. <i>I'm tired. I want to go home. </i>As these<br>thoughts cycle through his head, the train pulls up to the station near his office. The man<br>works as a mid-level engineer for a start-up IT venture called Dull, Inc.—the same job he's<br>held for the past four years. Each department holds a team huddle before starting the day.<br>The meetings are an excuse for bosses to talk, check in on progress, announce schedule<br>changes, and so forth. As the man's boss drones on and on, he tunes him out and thinks<br>back to the raid of the night before. He wonders what his actions in battle looked like to<br>his friends. Had he successfully played the part of Levania?<br><br>Whenever he plays him, his personality changes. Levania is a leader who takes initiative;<br>one who cracks wise with a keen sense of humor. Someone his companions can be honest with;<br>a person both trustworthy and charismatic. But this person—this role—only exists in the game.<br>In reality, the man is Levania's exact opposite. He is introverted, stoic, and lacks even one true<br>friend. He communicates only as much as necessary to get by in society, and has no desire to<br>take any of his relationships deeper. Additionally, he is plagued by a vague, smoldering<br>dissatisfaction of how unfair and irrational modern society is. The only thing that brings him joy<br>are games. Whether he is playing the work of another or crafting his own, it is the only time he<br>ever experiences happiness. His own game—which he's been working on in his spare time—<br>was reaching completion. It is an old-fashioned RPG where the player takes on the role of<br>hero to save a princess captured by the demon king. And of course, the hero's name is Levania.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">"Hey! You listening!?" The man suddenly snaps back to reality. The team huddle is<br>still going on. He sputters out a half-whispered apology for daydreaming, but it falls on deaf<br>ears. Instead, the boss takes the opportunity to berate him.<br><br>"You know, you could stand to be a lot more productive."<br>"Hell, we've got people with half your experience that are doing twice the work!"<br><br>The youngest member of the team graduated from college a mere two years ago, yet the<br>boss misses no chance to praise him for his work ethic.<br><br>"But sir," says the junior member suddenly, "he does a lot, too."<br>"I have a lot to learn, but he's always patient."<br>"And he's willing to help with whatever I need."<br><br>Rather than easing off at this, however, the man's boss doubles down.<br><br>"Do you see that!?" he roars.<br>"That kind of humble attitude is <i>exactly</i> what we need around here! Am I making myself clear!?"<br>The man glances at his coworker and sees his mouth twist into a sneer. <i>Gotcha!</i>, it seems to say.<br><br>Though the junior employee presents a humble, helpful front, he actually only takes<br>assignments that are sure to earn him praise—leaving the dirty, difficult work to the man.<br>He knows he's the boss's favorite, and uses this fact to his full advantage. And the boss thinks<br>he's found a new lackey, so he's willing to let his sneaky attitude slide. The man knows what<br>they both think of him: He is a target—a lump to be misused however they wish.<br><br>Lunchtime arrives. The man sits in the corner break area munching on a vending-machine<br>pastry. A stout coworker approaches with a can of coffee in hand and gives it to the man.<br>"Rough morning, huh?" he says.<br><br>This stout man is an engineer who joined the company at the same time as him and now works<br>on his team. Though not close enough to call each other friends, the man does not find his<br>coworker's thoughtfulness unpleasant. But he also knows him to be the type who tries to please<br>everyone and avoid making waves.<br><br>"Anyway, hope it all works out."<br>The stout man stands there awkwardly for a moment before shuffling back to his desk.<br><br>The day comes to a close. As the man is packing up to leave, his boss approaches.<br>He wonders dispassionately if he is in for another scolding. It turns out he is; his boss<br>immediately tears into him for one thing or another. But no matter what he says, it will never<br>resonate with the man. <i>This is just a job. It pays for food and a roof over my head. That's all.</i><br>The man repeats this to himself as he waits for his boss to tire himself out.<br><br>Eventually, he finds himself standing on the train home. It's full, but not uncomfortably<br>so, and he has room to scroll through his phone as he rides. As he peruses his usual gaming<br>news sites, an advertisement catches his eye. The game-development company that makes<br>his MMO is looking for an engineer. He typically scrolls through advertisements almost<br>unconsciously, but this one seizes his attention immediately and refuses to let go.<br><br>Later, the man sits down in front of his computer. Morning. He types a joking greeting<br>in the group chat, and several people immediately respond.<br><br>morning<br>did you just wake up? lol its night already<br>yay Levania's here!!!<br><br>He vaguely wonders why he feels so at home with these online strangers who he has never met,<br>then sets the question aside. For the next few hours, the man and his friends run raids together.<br><br>But their attempts go miserably. The party is disjointed and out of sorts, and they end<br>up falling apart at the end. The man apologizes for his poor leadership, and suggests a new<br>strategy for their next encounter. His teammates are aware the loss is not the man's fault, so<br>they listen to his plan and offer up occasional suggestions or tweaks. It is a very constructive<br>discussion. Eventually, as always, he must return to reality. His friends log off one after the<br>other, their names disappearing from the screen. Then, one of them offers a parting remark.<br><br>I bet you're really helpful irl too, Levania<br><br>It's a compliment, the kind of casual thing people exchange a dozen times a day. But it<br>causes a terrible sense of guilt to rise up in the man. <i>I'm fooling them. Lying to them. I'm nothing<br>like Levania in real life.</i> <i>But if I could, I would love to be just like him...</i><br><br>Though his body cries out for sleep, the man logs out of the game and opens his internet<br>browser. He arrives at the game developer's website and navigates to the section on open<br>positions. He doesn't want his online friends to know what he's like in reality. He doesn't want<br>them to be disappointed. But if he ever wants to change that, he will need to make a greater<br>change to himself, stop drifting through life, and take some initiative. Levania would know what<br>to do and put a plan in motion right away. In fact... After a brief moment of hesitation, he attaches<br>his resume and sends it off.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The man's smartphone lights up as he receives a notification. He has an email from the<br>game company congratulating him on passing their initial screening. Though the man hardly<br>ever shows emotion, he smiles as he reads the email again and again.<br><br>Several months later, the man finds himself entering the doors of the company in his<br>finest suit. He has spent the last few months burning the candle at both ends in order to complete<br>his game and use it as a sample of his work. They were clearly impressed, because they invited<br>him in for a face-to-face interview. Interviews have never been the man's forte, but he has a plan:<br>He will assume the role of Levania in his mind during the entire process. As they fire question<br>after question at him, he tries to react as if it was just another boss battle. It works better than<br>he could have imagined, and his answers are both positive and proactive. As the interview ends,<br>they compliment him again on his answers and his game, and he leaves the building floating on<br>air. He heads toward the train station. The sky above him is a cloudless, brilliant blue.<br><i>I think I aced that interview. I really do.</i> <i>If I get the job, I'll be reborn.</i> <i>I can be like Levania in my<br>real life.</i> <i>Then maybe I can be my true self around my online friends...</i> As the man sets off for home,<br>his face is alight with hope.<br><br>The next day... When the man arrives to work at Dull, Inc., he comes across the stout<br>coworker and junior teammate having a serious conversation. Though he doesn't wish to<br>eavesdrop, he finds he can't help himself. Their hushed voices still carry across the empty<br>office. It seems the junior employee has made a serious error in some of his work. Scared<br>of how their boss will react, he tried to bury it. But he now realizes he will not be able to keep<br>it hidden forever. Backed into a corner, he finally decided to seek out the other man for advice.<br>After hearing the story, the stout man leans back in his chair and knits his fingers together.<br><br>"You have to tell the boss," he says.<br>"Do it today."<br>"The longer you put it off, the worse it's going to be."<br><br>Clearly dejected, the young man wanders off in a daze.<br><br>Later that afternoon... The stout employee is called into the boss's office. The man<br>can't hear things clearly, but it's obvious from the tone that their boss is chewing him out.<br>A few words drift through the closed door, enough for the man to realize his coworker is<br>being blamed for the junior employee's mistake. <i>Why is he taking the blame?</i> <i>It wasn't even<br>his fault.</i> He glances around the room, and sees the junior employee and a couple of his<br>friends looking over at the boss's office and snickering behind their hands. <i>I'm going to<br>kill this guy.</i> He feels himself suddenly overwhelmed by terribly dark emotions. The man<br>suddenly realizes what happened: The junior teammate had pinned the mistake on his coworker.<br>He did so knowing full well their boss would never question the word of his favorite employee.<br>Unable to stand it a second more, he pushes his chair back and begins walking toward<br>the boss's office. <i>Grant me your courage, Levania. Just this once.</i> As he nears the office,<br>the conversation grows increasingly clear.<br><br>"You two were over there whispering earlier!" says the boss.<br>"Don't deny it!"<br><br>The man knows exactly how this will play out. In the end, his poor coworker will take the<br>blame. The man readies himself and opens the door.<br><br>"I'm busy here!" cries the boss.<br>"Can't you see that!?"<br><br>The man pauses, takes a deep breath, and begins to tell his side of the story. After a few<br>moments, his boss interrupts.<br><br>"I see. You're in on this too."<br>"Enough. Back to your desks, both of you."<br>"I'll figure out what to do with you later."<br><br>When he hears this, the man feels his willpower drain out of him. Though he swore to be a<br>stronger person like Levania, he's still himself at the end of the day. He can't even help a single<br>coworker. <i>I've had enough of this company.</i> <i>I've had enough of me.</i> <i>I wonder if this fight would<br>be too much even for Levania?</i> The man has no answer. But he knows one thing: Trying to fight<br>a boss like his is pointless.<br><br>Several weeks later... The man receives a letter. It is a formal offer of employment from<br>the game company.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The man receives a formal offer of employment from the game company. The next day,<br>the man walks into his boss's office and hands him a letter. It is his two-week notice. But it is<br>also notice that he plans to take the rest of those two weeks off as vacation, and will only come<br>back for his final day of work. He will still leave the job with far more vacation than he can ever<br>use, but he doesn't care. He simply wants to get out. His boss receives the letter coolly,<br>showing no particular sorrow or surprise.<br><br>He then informs the team of his departure during the morning huddle. Soon, word<br>spreads to the rest of the office. After the meeting, the stout coworker approaches the man<br>and places a hand on his shoulder.<br>"Thanks for all your hard work—and for trying."<br><br>They both know what he is referring to: After the incident with the junior coworker, each of<br>the men received a reduction in salary. The fact he was punished for the fault of another upset<br>the man greatly. But there was nothing to be done. The stout coworker, never one to make<br>waves, simply accepted the pay cut without a word and continued on.<br><br>That night... For the first time ever, the man and his coworker head out for a night on the town.<br>Though his team held occasional drinking parties, he had never attended one. He never had<br>a reason to. But this time, his falsely accused coworker had invited him, and they both<br>understood it would be the first and last time such a thing ever happened.<br><br>At the bar... Alcohol works its dark magic and the man begins to open up. He talks about<br>his favorite games, his next job, and his hopes and dreams for the future. He speaks of his<br>desire to change himself. He has never laid himself bare like this; it is both liberating and<br>terrifying. His tipsy coworker listens for a long time before finally responding,<br>"I'll be so lonely with you gone."<br><br>Two weeks later... It's the man's last day at work. He leaves his house with a spring in<br>his step. The thought of never entering Dull, Inc. again makes the packed train feel like a vacation.<br>All he has to do today is finish some paperwork and sign a couple of documents. Once he turns in<br>his security badge, he will walk out the front door for the very last time. Before he reports to<br>security, he wanders the office looking for the stout coworker so he can say goodbye. But he<br>can't find him anywhere. He asks the junior teammate if he's seen him and the man responds,<br>"That guy? How should I know?"<br><br>Yet again, he feels his blood begin to run cold as rage overwhelms him. Perhaps his coworker<br>called in sick. Perhaps he had a planned day off. With no other choice, the man finishes his<br>paperwork and leaves.<br><br>He then makes his way to the station. He stands at the center of the platform, waiting<br>for his train to arrive. It's early, and the station is relatively empty. Tomorrow, he will begin a<br>new life at a new company. He will never have to set foot in this station again. It is another in<br>a series of goodbyes. A momentary feeling of loneliness quickly transforms into one of<br>excitement. <i>Starting tomorrow, I'll be reborn in a new world—<br>one where no one knows me.</i> <i>I'll be strong and reliable, just like Levania.</i> The light of hope<br>shines brightly on the man's heart.<br><br>A voice echoes through the station announcing the arrival of the next train.<br><br>......<br>............<br>..................<br><br>Suddenly, something collides with the man from behind. He stumbles forward and goes flying<br>onto the tracks. <i>What happened?</i> <i>Where are my glasses?</i> <i>Oh god, I need to get back!</i><br>But the man finds himself frozen in confusion and fear. A lone figure looks down on him from<br>the platform. It is muttering something.<br><br>"With you gone..."<br>The man's head snaps up. Standing before him was the coworker the man had tried to protect.<br><br>"With you gone..."<br>"<i>I'll</i> be the one they bully!"<br>"I can't <i>stand</i> that!"<br>"I can't <i>stand</i> the thought of you being happier than me!"<br>"But with you gone—"<br><br>The shrill sound of a train whistle drowns out the rest of the thought. All sound stops. In a<br>silent vortex of darkness, a few thoughts swirl:<br><i>I don't want to die. I want to keep living.</i><br><i>Dreams... Hope...</i><br><i>Re...born...</i><br><br><i>I... I... I...</i><br><br><br><i>I...am...</i></p>
