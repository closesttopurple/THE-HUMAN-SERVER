<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A cold, biting wind howls through the spaces between houses.<br>The town sits at the foot of a mythical and sacred mountain, its peaks standing against gray skies.<br>Among the adventurers preparing to climb the mountain is a woman.<br>In stark contrast to the heroic builds of the others, she is hardly blessed with a robust physique.<br>Yet her eyes burn with an unshakable will and resolution every bit as bright as theirs.<br>Despite her youth, she has considerable adventuring experience under her belt.<br>She breathes deep to whet her spirit.<br>She reflects on her memories to prepare for the fight to come.<br>Prior to coming here, she heard all sorts of rumors about the sacred mountain.<br>Whispers of a wild and vicious yeti...<br>Tales of an all-healing herb near the peak...<br>Rumors of disembodied voices of the dead luring climbers into darkness.<br>Some rumors are eerie and meant to evoke fear, while others are fantastical and strange.<br>The mythical mountain is majestic, profound, primeval.<br>Its ever-present looming and the people's devout dread are the sources of all manner of conjecture.<br>As she ponders the mountain, she steels her resolve anew.<br>She's finally done readying herself and her things.<br>The residents of the town, especially other women, speak to her with worry.<br>The mountain is much too dangerous for you.<br>A woman climbing the mountain? That's downright rash.<br>Think of the family you're leaving behind!<br>There's no mischief or malice in their voices—their concern is genuine.<br>They sympathize with the woman while also admonishing her.<br>They've seen countless men off and have witnessed almost as many failures.<br>And their own family members surely made up some of that number.<br>More than a few wives and daughters have watched their families fall apart.<br>Their feelings for the mountain are odd and complex.<br>But their distress is readily apparent to the adventurer woman.<br>Even more so because she, too, has experienced the same.<br>Her father was an adventurer who left her mother and unborn child behind to climb this mountain,<br>only to abruptly lose his life here.<br>Said unborn child was her little brother.<br>Even in the womb, her little brother was in poor health.<br>It wasn't certain if he'd be born without complications if he lived at all—the doctor's diagnosis was dire.<br>But miraculously, he was born healthy and grew well.<br>This was shortly after her father left her mother behind and prioritized climbing the mountain,<br>never to return.<br>When the woman was still but a girl,<br>she couldn't understand what it was he gave up and what he was trying to conquer.<br>She couldn't understand why he wasn't there when her mother was in pain.<br>Why he sought the mountain.<br>Her father harbored a deep desire to master the art of adventure.<br>The woman would understand what that meant only many years later.<br>That's just who your father is.<br>It was her mother's common refrain whenever the woman's resentment<br>and resistance caused her to question him.<br>But something in particular eventually led her to read his journal.<br>Ever since then, her perspective of him changed drastically.<br>Her father was an awkward man.<br>But he was someone she was meant to surpass.<br>She chose the same path as him, one of adventure.<br>In her eyes, this mountain is a place of destiny, an object of revenge.<br>She remembers it like it was only yesterday.<br>Before she read the journal, her father once murmured something in her presence.<br>Y'know, if you were a boy, I'd take ya on an adventure with me.<br>Thinking on it now, she wonders if perhaps he simply didn't want to put his daughter in danger.<br>Perhaps witnessing his wife distance herself from adventuring after giving birth influenced him.<br>But when the woman heard him speak those words,<br>she began to cry for reasons she didn't understand.<br>An emotion she could not name, neither loneliness nor sorrow, welled up inside of her.<br>Her repulsion toward her father exploded.<br>She could no longer bear the vexation.<br>Why had she been born a girl?<br>Why couldn't she live up to her father's expectations?<br>Even now, long after her complicated feelings for her father have melted away,<br>she still cannot forget that frustration.<br>And that is why she must balance the scales.<br>She must climb the legendary mountain her father failed to conquer<br>and claim those peaks for herself.<br><i>If you were a boy...</i><br><i>But I'm a girl...</i><br>She brushed away those flawed convictions and became a true adventurer in her own right.<br>She would prove her skill as his daughter.<br>She cannot deny the fear and unease, of course, but it's too late to turn back now.<br>She can already hear her mother laugh dryly, but this, too, flows in her blood.<br>I won't lose to you, Dad.<br>Wearing the mittens she once wove but never had the chance to give to her father,<br>the adventuring woman sets off for the mountain.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The wind is far colder than it was in the town.<br>The adventuring woman begins climbing the mountain that her father failed to conquer.<br>The path is steep, but she's determined to surpass her father.<br>Fatigue is nowhere to be found on her face.<br>Rather, her expression is one of ferocity and joy, as though bravery wells up within her.<br>It's a face her father never saw.<br>My little girl, once so adorable and small...<br>An astonished man looks at the woman.<br>Astonished indeed.<br>The man is none other than her father, the very man who attempted to conquer this mountain and failed.<br>The souls of adventurers who failed the climb remain on the mountain.<br>His existence is hollow and cannot be seen, but his spirit burns.<br>Though she has grown and matured, the man knows his daughter when he sees her.<br>The mountain is steep, and loneliness wears her down,<br>but the smile beaming across the woman's face is one of excitement and delight.<br>She has clearly inherited the man's adventuring blood.<br>But what ebbs and flows in his chest is not sentimentality for the life she's led thus far.<br>Rather, what concerns him the most is her mountaineering technique.<br>She's chosen to traverse the same peaks as him,<br>which requires appropriate strength, refined skills, and, above all else, spirit to match.<br>On this mountain especially, even the smallest of reservations will quickly pull the rug out<br>from underneath any climber.<br>The man keeps a close eye on his daughter's every move.<br>The man knows all too well the challenges this mountain has to offer.<br>Chasms in the ground run deeper than the darkest abyss.<br>Boisterous squalls blow from sudden blizzards.<br>Every obstacle the man overcame with spirit and grit alone relentlessly assail the woman.<br>But she faces these trials in ways completely unlike his approach.<br>There's a particular crevice he once braved with strength alone.<br>Instead, she places a foldable ladder over it and deftly crosses.<br>That little ladder will not save you! the man bellows.<br>But his voice is little more than the faint whisper of the dead.<br>The woman cannot hear him.<br>Disregarding his panicked yell, she continues along and misses her step.<br>He was right.<br>The man covers his eyes and wails, but he never hears the woman scream.<br>The lifeline she attached to herself beforehand comes in handy.<br>She calmly climbs back onto the ladder and then carefully continues to the other side of the gap.<br>She has a meticulousness that the man never had.<br>He's amazed by her skill.<br>But upon reaching the other side, a sudden and ferocious blizzard batters the woman,<br>just as he expected.<br>Her vision is blanketed by white in the span of a second.<br>She can't see an inch in front of her.<br>The wind's piercing howl robs her of her hearing all the while.<br>The man once fell into the same predicament.<br>He relied on his own wild instincts to find the path again.<br>He prays his daughter inherited the same instincts.<br>He is practically beside himself with unease.<br>But in stark contrast to his emotions, the woman shows no sign of panic.<br>He notices her rummaging around in her supplies, and she produces a compass.<br>She turns until the needle points precisely north.<br>With careful steps, she follows the path.<br>What kind of gadget is that!?<br>Compasses are hardly a new invention, but the man reacts as though he's never seen one.<br>He always adventured on raw vigor, after all.<br>The blizzard finally calms, and her vision returns to her.<br>Watching his daughter's progress, the man finds himself deeply impressed by their differences.<br>Though their approaches were hardly the same, his daughter is, without a doubt,<br>risking her life on this journey.<br>She is a true adventurer in her own right.<br>To think she's grown so much...<br>The man does not dwell on his own biases.<br>Rather, he rejoices in the birth of a stalwart and capable adventurer.<br>Unaware of his satisfied gaze, the woman presses forward through the mountain.<br>Having made it this far, it's possible that she might reach the peak.<br>In fact, he's certain she can.<br>Both father and daughter are ablaze with conviction in that moment.<br>But then, her ears pick up on the starved breath of a wild animal.<br>She holds her breath and strains her eyes.<br>There, she spots a wolf.<br>And it's not alone.<br>There are countless ferocious wolves in the pack, and they stare unwaveringly at their valuable prey.<br>Both father and daughter brace themselves.<br>The man has no way to help.<br>He clenches his hand into a firm fist.<br>The woman takes a deep breath and prepares to face off against the wolves...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">As the woman proceeds through the harsh and unforgiving mountain,<br>watched over by the spirit of her father,<br>she finds herself surrounded by a pack of wolves.<br>Their ravenous hunger is palpable against the mountain's crisp air.<br>Or perhaps it's a thirst for life; a desire no human could ever taste.<br>The wolf pack and the adventurer anticipate the other's first move.<br>If one misjudges the other's strength, they will lose.<br>Both the adventurer and wolves know this well.<br>All the while, the lingering ghost of the father is beside himself with impatience.<br>He is the first to thrash about, desperately trying to drive away the wolves.<br>But his ludicrous dance is invisible to both parties.<br>His daughter is one lunge away from death.<br>He grinds his teeth.<br><i>Crunch.</i><br>The gentle noise of snow underfoot echoes through the quiet mountain.<br>The wolf pack leader makes the first move with a furious leap.<br>Sharp, ferocious fangs fly straight for the woman.<br>The father screams.<br>But suddenly, the wolf falls to the ground.<br>Panic ripples through the pack.<br>The woman does not let this chance go.<br>She throws her fist against one wolf and then another.<br>And then, she lets out a ferocious bellow.<br>Their will to fight completely stolen from them, the wolves, quite literally,<br>run away with their tails between their legs.<br>It is with great effort and wit that she has so skillfully overcome these difficulties.<br>And now, the woman has earned an overwhelming victory through pure and tenacious strength.<br>She then sets off silently.<br>I was worried for a sec there, but that's my girl! It'll take more than some mangy mutts to do her in.<br>Forgetting his panic, the man smiles proudly.<br>The sole source of his unease now is that he can no longer hear the echoes through the mountain,<br>sounds which rang constantly when he was alive and always lifted his spirits.<br>Unaware of her father's booming laughter, the woman presses onward.<br>The man follows her frantically, nearly losing sight of her.<br>At last, she reaches the shrine that sits atop this legendary peak.<br>A place of myth, one her adventuring father hoped to reach but never saw.<br>Taking in the majestic sight, she finally realizes that she has surpassed her father.<br>Still think girls can't be adventurers, Dad?<br>Her head spins from excitement and elation.<br>She takes a deep breath and looks to the ground.<br>There, she notices something.<br>A notebook.<br>A plain notebook one would use as a journal.<br>She picks it up and flips through it.<br>She recognizes the writing inside.<br>It's her father's writing.<br>Reading her father's journal was one of her very first memories.<br>The journal that held all the emotions he couldn't contain when his daughter was born.<br>All at once, her memories of her father come back to her vividly.<br>She stews in the memories, savoring them.<br>Something in the air changes.<br>Suddenly, a huge man appears before her.<br>Could this be the abominable yeti she had heard so much about?<br>She's hardly prepared to face such a foe.<br>Just as she's about to scream in horror—<br>You can see me?<br>The figure's deep voice stirs her memory.<br>Despite her bewilderment, she grasps what he truly is.<br>Is this a result of the shrine's mysterious power?<br>Is this a miracle brought on by the journal?<br>Whatever the case, she can now see what remains of her father's spirit.<br>Ordinarily, parent and child would embrace in tears, rejoicing in their unexpected reunion.<br>But their relationship is complicated and far from ordinary.<br>Both father and daughter have so much to say to one another.<br>But their words do not come.<br>An awkward silence settles between the two on the quiet, majestic peak.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The deep mountains are silent, apart from the distant wail of the frigid wind.<br>Here, on the highest cliff that few climbers could ever reach,<br>stands an adventurer father and adventurer daughter, both struggling to find words.<br>The woman cannot speak, but it is not because the spirit of her dead father has manifested before her.<br>Nor is it because she's desperately trying to keep her tears at bay—he looks exactly<br>the same as she remembered him.<br>And nor is it due to a surge of spiteful remarks she's suppressing that form a lump in her throat.<br>Or so she thinks.<br>It's her father who finally breaks the long stretch of silence.<br>He explains why he didn't come home from the mountain and all that transpired.<br>It wasn't because of any mysterious or unexpected phenomena, he says.<br>His hand simply slipped, and he lost his hold on the cliff face.<br>But he still managed to move.<br>He dragged his legs behind him as they lost all feeling.<br>He crawled his way to the peak, but it was there that he died.<br>And that's more or less the whole of it. Look at me now.<br>He wears a self-deprecating smile, one she never saw during his life.<br>It's quite the contrast to his old, prideful self.<br>It gives her a peculiarly fresh impression of him.<br>Perhaps now he'll be willing to talk about the family he left behind.<br>But before she can speak, the man quickly changes the subject.<br>So! What sort of adventures have you been on?<br>He beams with glee.<br>It's not his wife or son he asks about first, but his daughter's own adventures.<br>What was supposed to be a touching reunion has been desecrated in the worst way she can imagine.<br>Not a single word of apology for abandoning his family?<br>Surely he has something more important to talk about.<br>The woman opens her mouth, prepared to unleash a lashing of emotional objection.<br>But hasn't her father always been like this?<br>Yelling at him now will change nothing.<br>And even if the dead could have a change of heart, she'd gain nothing from it.<br>Once her father, always her father.<br>In spite of her annoyance, she smiles and begins to talk about her adventures.<br>She's crossed many mountains up to this point,<br>though none of them anywhere near as treacherous as this one.<br>She's traversed vast savannahs on foot, home to prides of brutal lions.<br>She's set out onto endless seas in search of pirate treasure and even battled<br>the great creatures of the deep.<br>I always wondered what you would do, Dad.<br>As he listens to the daring and detailed descriptions of her experiences,<br>he gives several satisfied nods.<br>Taking joy in his daughter's growth, another feeling fills the gap in his heart—<br>A bottomless well of desire for adventure.<br>Hm. If it were me...<br>He trails off and looks to the sky.<br>What would he have done?<br>Even in death, his daughter's adventures set his heart aflutter.<br>But what about him?<br><i>What would I do next?</i><br>The same as you, that's what.<br><i>We really are the same, aren't we?</i><br>The man gives a thoughtful response, then continues with even more vigor.<br>No adventurer stays in one place for long, you know!<br>Just as the woman finds satisfaction with this response and opens her mouth to respond,<br>the man is already gone.<br>All that's left in his place are heavenly, glimmering ice crystals.<br>As she stares at them blankly, the woman finally understands.<br>The spirit of the man trapped on the mountain has finally been freed and laid to rest.<br>All thanks to that incurable desire for adventure, one that even had the power to erase his regrets.<br>One man, obsessed with adventure...<br>Now, finally off to a new land. The next life.<br>Dozens of hours later...<br>The woman descends from the mountain with only the most minor of injuries.<br>She returns straight home, greeted by her mother and younger brother,<br>and she thinks back on the journal she retrieved.<br>Like the child she was when she first stealthily read her father's journal,<br>she once again opens the notebook.<br>Inside, she finds his feelings for her little brother, who was still in her mother's womb.<br>His deep love for his family.<br>His reason for setting off for the sacred mountain.<br>He had gone to find the herb said to be all-healing—<br>its very existence still debated—all for his unborn son.<br>Neither the adventurer woman nor her mother had any idea.<br>They had thought he set off for the mountain for adventure alone.<br>They <i>assumed</i>. From that assumption, complicated feelings were born.<br>All he had to do was tell them his true intentions.<br>If only.<br>Saying so would have been so easy.<br>But he simply wasn't that kind of person.<br>Those words would have been far too direct for him.<br>That very same nature has a home in the woman as well.<br>Now, knowing her father's true intentions,<br>she has completely forgotten her curse of being born a girl. She closes the journal.<br>And then...<br>She rests the mittens she ultimately did not give him atop it.<br>You really were an awkward man, she murmurs.<br>The woman smiles warmly.</p></p>
