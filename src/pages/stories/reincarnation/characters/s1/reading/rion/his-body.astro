<img src="https://i.imgur.com/orGTwk9.png">
<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A boy of good upbringing moves across a vast wasteland, and a taciturn
man follows. They mind their surroundings with unease, almost as if they fear
pursuit, until they finally reach a small, windswept town where they hope to
shake the road from their weary bones.</p>
<p class="para">Most of the townsfolk merely observe the passing visitors with cautious eyes,
but when they approach an eatery, a pack of hard men block their path.<br>
"You royalty, boy?" sneers one of them. His companions all draw iron at
the question, but the taciturn man is faster. After the foes run off into
the dust, the man turns to the boy and asks a single question:</p>
<p class="para">"Are you hurt, My Prince?"</p>
<p class="para">"I am no longer a prince," replies the boy.</p>
<p class="para">The pair then decides to take their leave of the town.</p>
<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">A female bounty hunter with two mechanical limbs walks into a saloon and begins
asking after certain individuals. Though the information she obtains is vague,
it proves to be more than enough. She has caught the scent of her prey,
and it leads her to the forest.</p>
<p class="para">But as she makes to leave, another bounty hunter blocks her path. She is known
for her success as a bounty hunter, and this man demands she hand over all
her coin. But the fight is over before it can begin; no mediocre highwayman
could hope to stand against the fires of revenge that fuel the woman. As her
would-be assailant lies dying in the dust, she steps over him and continues on.</p>
<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">In a forest near a ruined church, the man searches for food; he knows the boy
must eat, but the pickings are slim indeed. Eventually, he finds a single apple
on the ground. But when he takes it up, a starving bear crashes through the
underbrush and stares at the meal with hungry, desperate eyes.</p>
<p class="para">After putting the bear to rout, the man returns to the boy, who lies safely
at the back of the chapel. Though he has always been sickly, this merciless
journey has chipped away at what remains of his lifeâ€”and when the man offers
him the apple, his body is too weak to accept it.</p>
<p class="para">The man cannot help the boy now.<br>
All he can do is stay by his side and wait for the end.</p>
<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ONZWgE2.png">
<p class="para">The bounty hunter with prosthetic limbs arrives at the ruins of a once-proud church. The
ceiling is collapsed, the walls mere suggestions; it is more shell than structure now. Inside,
she finds her targets: a deteriorated mechanical soldier and a corpse the size of a child. But
when she takes a single step forward, the clockwork man springs to life. With a howl that
could be creaking joints or the wail of a dying soul, the man turns his gun on the woman.</p>
<p class="para">The boy died a century ago. After being chased from his homeland, he traveled
with the clockwork man and tried to stop the war ravaging his kingdom, but his
life was lost before he could accomplish his mission. Yet the man continued to
safeguard his charge, attacking any who dared approach the boy long after his
once-proud body had fallen to rust.</p>
<p class="para">But this is a place of respite now, and the clockwork man will not move again.
The woman gives them a proper burial, then turns and leaves the forest
without a sound.</p>
