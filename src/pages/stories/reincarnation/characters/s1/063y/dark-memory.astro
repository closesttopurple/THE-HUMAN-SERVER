<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">"Morning, sleepyhead. You getting up today?"<br>The man gently places his hand on his wife's cheek as he speaks; her skin is cool to the touch.<br><i>Her temperature must drop while she sleeps</i>, he thinks. The woman does not so much as stir.<br>The only sound in the room is her deep, steady breathing. It is the only way he knows she still lives.<br>She has been asleep for nearly two weeks.<br><br>Ten days ago, they fought Flowers in the city ruins. It was a relentless battle, and many<br>did not see it through to come out intact on the other side. His wife's head was injured during the<br>skirmish, and though the wound is healing nicely, she remains unconscious. The doctor said it was<br>an after-effect of receiving a strong blow to the brain. He also warned the man she might never<br>regain herself. He knows he should be happy she still lives. Nonetheless, he finds himself praying:<br>"Please wake up, honey. <i>Please.</i>"<br><br>The man had already lost his son to the Flowers. And now they threatened to steal his wife as well.<br>His body shivers in fear at the prospect, the anxiety boring a hole in his heart. The Flowers were<br>taking everything from him. <i>Everything.</i> Hate swirls inside him as he unconsciously clenches his<br>hands into fists. If only he could eradicate the Flowers...<br>If only he had the strength to kill them...<br><br><i>All right, enough of that. She's going to wake up.</i> The man draws himself up straight, patching<br>the hole in his heart through sheer force of will. Soon, a voice comes over the PA announcing<br>mealtime. Even this dreary announcement, played at the same time every day, serves to take his<br>mind from his troubles. For the first time ever, he finds the managed routines and strict rules of his<br>lifestyle are granting him a sense of security and peace.<br><br>"I'm off to eat, honey," he whispers.<br>"Be back soon."<br><br>The man makes his way to the feeding hall. It is a simple space fitted with sterile terminals where<br>people receive meals after scanning their IDs, as well as rows of small tables where they can eat.<br>Right now, it is filled with prisoners who live in the man's block. They line up in neat rows, receive<br>the same food, plop down in assigned seats, and eat silently. The prisoners are treated like animals;<br>it is an unnerving sight. But tools for war must be properly managed. The man looks at the empty seat<br>beside him where his wife would typically sit. The food seems even more bland than usual this day.<br><br>Suddenly, the voice of their commander rings out.<br>"Eyes on, people!" Tension ripples through the prisoners; an appearance from the commander<br>typically foreshadows a problem.<br>"We are currently recruiting testers for new equipment. Anyone who wishes to take part can apply<br>at the terminal in their room. That is all."<br><br>The message delivered, he spins on a heel and leaves. The prisoners breathe a sigh of relief. The<br>R&amp;D Department was constantly researching weapons and other gear that might be of use against<br>the Flowers. They managed every aspect of the prisoners' equipment, right down to what they wore<br>in their daily lives. Their clothes heightened the wearer's resistances and strength, but also allowed<br>the commander control of their bodies and minds. Despite their ill feelings toward their garb, they<br>all agreed the clothes had saved their lives on multiple occasions. For the man, however, the fact<br>he is no better than a slave is something he has made peace with—for he will shoulder any burden<br>and bear any pain to have his revenge. He will do whatever is necessary.<br><br><i>New equipment, eh? Interesting...</i><br><br>With more powerful weapons and equipment, they could inflict more damage on the Flowers and<br>return from battle with fewer casualties. And maybe even end the war altogether. The man knows<br>many people will apply to test the new equipment, because they all share this same goal.<br>Plus, better equipment means a better chance of survival. The man thinks it over. Though he wishes<br>to stay at his wife's side, he knows he won't actually be able to <i>do</i> anything for her. So when he<br>returns to his room, he turns on his terminal and applies to test the new equipment.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Several days later, the man finds himself walking toward the R&amp;D training room. When<br>he arrives, five prisoners are already there. These are the applicants who were chosen. There<br>does not seem to be a particular type: he sees all kinds, from muscle-bound men to slender,<br>wiry women. Once they are gathered, the commander begins to speak:<br>"Put your gear on and prepare to spar."<br><br>The commander brings out six sets of bizarre clothing. They are called enhancement suits, and each<br>one upgrades its wearer in different ways.<br><br>The man's suit is called a "power model."<br>It is designed to heighten the wearer's physical strength. The outfit is completely black, and has<br>a solemn, imposing air. It is made from a thick, heavy material that seems designed to function as a<br>flexible suit of armor. He puts it on and closes the seals, noting with grim satisfaction how it encloses<br>his entire body. The remaining five suits for the other prisoners consist of three combat-oriented<br>models—speed, defense, and magic—and two support models: scout and medic. Today, they will be<br>testing the combat suits.<br><br>His suit ready, the man walks to the middle of the room. Opposite him is a man in a speed<br>suit. He can't be more than twenty years old—little more than a kid. His suit is bright yellow, and<br>appears only lightly armored. <i>Speed, eh? I wonder how fast we're talkin' here.</i> The two combatants<br>face each other, muscles tense. After a few moments, a buzzer sounds.<br>"I'm coming for you, old man!" screams the kid.<br><br>The moment the words leave his mouth, he closes the distance between them in a blur. Before the<br>man even knows what is happening, the kid punches him square in the face. He stumbles across<br>the room before coming to a stop against the back wall.<br><br>"Oh, it ain't naptime yet, pops!"<br>The kid races across the room before the man can even regain his feet. He begins dancing around<br>him, always in his blind spot, pummeling him with a series of rapid blows and kicks. But the man<br>feels no pain. The impact is intense, but lacks the power to penetrate his armor. The kid quickly<br>seems to grasp this as well, and redoubles his attacks in an effort to pummel his foe into some kind<br>of submission. His arms move too fast to be seen. His legs are streaks of yellow light.<br><br>"Give up already, you dog!" the kid taunts.<br>With each strike the kid makes, he tosses in a barb of the tongue. The man can't tell if his opponent<br>is trying to goad him into sloppiness or is just always like this. Regardless, the kid clearly has the<br>mindset of a warrior. The man places his back against the wall and raises his guard. Though each<br>strike by itself does little damage, he knows the kid's furious onslaught will eventually wear him<br>down. The man looks for chances to strike back, but the kid's speed shows no sign of slowing.<br>Perhaps the speed suit also raises his stamina. Regardless, the power model is heavy, and unsuited<br>to prolonged fights. <i>Time for a new plan...</i><br><br>"Was that you hitting me just now, kid? I thought a fly landed on me."<br>"The hell did you say!?"<br><br>Taking the bait, the young man launches a roundhouse kick. His foot makes contact with the<br>man's side, sending a shockwave through his entire body.... But it also leaves an opening. Before the<br>kid can recover, the man rears back and drives a fist into his gut. The young man stops moving.<br>He stands in place, wobbling back and forth like a dying top, then slumps to the ground.<br><br>"N-nice shot, buddy..." says the kid as he fades into unconsciousness.<br>"But next time, I...won't lose..."<br>"Heh. You fought well, kid."<br><br>The man chuckles at his opponent's unceasing confidence, even when staring down defeat.<br>His clouded heart feels a bit lighter.<br><br>The prisoners—including the kid—spend the next few days in their suits, pushing them to<br>their very limits. Once this is done, they are ready to test them for true.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Urban Residential District: Block One The prisoners stand in a line amidst abandoned<br>buildings. Each one is clad in a different suit. Their mission is to eliminate all Flowers in the area.<br>Though technically a capability test of the suits, it is still a genuine battle. If the test goes well, the<br>enhancement suits would be officially rolled out as new equipment, and hopefully increase the survival<br>rates of all prisoners. The six are determined to make the mission a success. The scout activates her<br>sensors and scans the area. Ten Flowers are detected in Block Three. Flowers typically live in easily<br>spotted clusters. However, there are also stealth types that do not show up on scans. They will have<br>to keep their guards up at all times. The six slowly and carefully pick their way through the ruins.<br><br>Urban Residential District: Block Three The party receives visual confirmation of ten Flowers<br>straight ahead. They are relieved to hear the scout's information was accurate, and proceed to the<br>next phase of the plan. The magic unit initiates the attack. She fires a heat ray from a massive gun,<br>transforming a nearby Flower to ash. This model of suit is vulnerable while firing, but a surprise attack<br>solves that problem.<br><br>"Go, kid!" yells the man.<br>"Do your thing!"<br><br>The kid leaps into a cluster of Flowers and begins raining blows down upon them. The man follows<br>close behind, swinging a massive greatsword that mows down everything in its path.<br><br>The battle is over in an instant. The power of the suits is overwhelming. They will turn the<br>tide of the war. But this overwhelming victory—and the hope it brings—makes them sloppy, and<br>they drop their guard.<br><br>"Look out!" cries the scout.<br>"Something's co—"<br><br>A Flower emerges from the ground under the scout's feet. She is thrown to the side, where she<br>lands with her neck at an impossible angle. Death is instantaneous.<br>"Everyone, behind me!" yells the defense unit.<br><br>He raises a shield as the others form up in his wake. More Flowers rip through the ground beneath<br>them. The magic unit is torn in two, causing chunks of flesh and bone to rain down around them.<br><i>Don't lose heart now</i>, thinks the man as he grips his sword. Over a dozen Flowers now loom around<br>them—and a moment later, they unleash hell. The defense unit adjusts his position to take the brunt<br>of the attack, while the medic does her best to keep him upright. Meanwhile, the speed and power<br>units make their way through the chaos, cutting down one Flower before moving on to the next.<br>It is a solid battle plan—at least at first. But while the medic can heal wounds, she is powerless<br>against the pain that accompanies a broken bone or a dislocated joint. Slowly but surely, pain begins<br>to overwhelm the defense unit. Finally, it becomes too much to bear. He turns to flee the<br>battlefield, and is immediately set upon and torn apart by a pair of Flowers. Six of the creatures now<br>remain, and the man in his power suit steps into place at the fore. Each time a Flower strikes at him,<br>he responds with a vicious attack of his own.<br><br><i>I won't die here. Not now. Not like this.</i><br><i>I won't leave my wife all alone!</i><br><br>This thought is enough to carry him through the fight. The man hears a terrible sound—a cry of fear<br>and pain and utter, complete rage. He does not even realize he is the one making it.<br><br>Time passes. Time stands still. Eventually the man emerges from his bloodlust<br>and sees the kid resting on his knees.<br><br>"W-we did it..." whispers the kid.<br>"We actually did it."<br><br>Only then does the man notice the shredded remains of Flowers all around them. There might still<br>be more lurking underground. If so, he does not have the energy to fight. Suddenly, he hears a<br>familiar announcement:<br><br>"Enhancement suit battle test complete."<br>"Commencing phase three of the experiment."<br><br>As though triggered by the voice, pain courses through his head. Suddenly, a voice rings out,<br>blocking all other thought.<br><br>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.<br>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.<br>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.<br>KILL THE ENEMY.<br><br>At the last line, the man loses consciousness.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">When the man's eyes next flutter open, he finds himself lying on the floor. He struggles to<br>his feet as the fog begins to lift from his mind... And he beholds a grisly sight. The floor is a lake of<br>blood. In the center, hunks of flesh and a broken staff. <i>That staff... It's the medic's.</i> The man examines<br>the chunks and finally finds what remains of the medic's face. Her suit has been forcefully pried open<br>and her skin peeled from her very bones. There's not even enough left for a proper burial. The man<br>feels nausea building inside him and turns away. But this only reveals a new horror: The kid—or what<br>remains of him. He has been impaled on a massive greatsword. His arms have been plucked from the<br>body and discarded; his face is little more than a ruined crater. It appears the corpse was pummeled<br>into submission long past the point where the man who existed inside was dead.<br><br><i>No... No, this can't be...</i><br><br>A horrible feeling crawls up his spine. Cold sweat runs down his face.<br><br><i>That sword... It's mine.</i><br><br>"You killed him," says a familiar voice.<br>The man whirls around to find the commander.<br><br>"I...killed him?"<br><br>His mind rejects this fact, as does his heart. But he cannot deny his bloody hands. Or his black<br>suit—which is now a vivid red.<br><br><i>I did this... Oh god, I did this!</i><br><br>"Calm yourself. You are not to blame here."<br>The commander proceeds to tell him everything.<br><br>It had all been an experiment. Command had set up the Flowers' surprise attack—<br>and once it was over, they deprived the prisoners of consciousness and had them fight to the death.<br>The commander had planned everything. After revealing this, he begins to regale the man with tales<br>of all the data they gained from the experiment, his glee barely contained. But the man cannot hear<br>him. His thoughts are a whirling vortex of rage.<br><br>"It appears to be somewhat dependent on the user's mental state and personality,"<br>continues the commander.<br>"But overall, the power suit was shown to provide the best balance of offense and defense."<br>"We will begin mass-manufacturing it at once."<br><br>The man's rage compresses, finding a target in the commander.<br>"So my friends died for a goddamn <i>test</i>?" he growls.<br>"No progress is without sacrifice," says the commander.<br><br>His tone is flat, as if the subject bores him. Enraged, the man rears back and launches a fist directly<br>at the commander's face. But his arm stops before it connects, his body refusing to allow it.<br>For all his power, he is still a prisoner.<br><br>"DAMN YOU TO HELL!" he wails.<br><br>The commander stares at the man impassively.<br>"I could dispose of you here and now, you know?<br>It actually might be the smart thing to do, considering all that you've learned."<br><br>An image of the man's wife leaps into his mind. <i>I can't die yet.</i> The man furrows his brow and<br>slowly lowers his fist.<br><br>"Good. What happened here today will be our little secret."<br>"We expect great things from your tenacity, prisoner."<br>"No sacrifice is too great if it means victory over the Flowers."<br><br>This said, the commander collects some bits of suits and departs. Silence fills the void.<br><br><i>I can't die yet. I can't die yet. I can't die yet.</i><br><br>The man repeats these four words over and over. <i>I have to live for her.</i> <i>And the more of us who<br>wear these suits, the more of us who will survive.</i> <i>He's right. This is a</i> good <i>thing.</i> The man had<br>killed them all—Flower and friend alike. Yet he felt a sense of might at his power. A sense of guilt<br>for his actions. And a sense of excitement at the possibilities. All of these things eat away at him.<br><i>I am strong enough to protect.</i> <i>I am strong enough to kill.</i> The darkness inside him swells and<br>writhes and expands until finally it consumes what remains of his heart.</p>
