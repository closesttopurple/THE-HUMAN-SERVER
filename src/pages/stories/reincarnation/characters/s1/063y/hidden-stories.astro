<p class="title">Chapter 1: Escape (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">The alarm shrieks throughout<br>the base, disturbing the<br>pristine silence of the night.<br><br>"ALERT. DESERTER DETECTED.<br>CAPTURE ALIVE IF POSSIBLE."<br><br>I hear the commander's voice<br>murmuring from the comms<br>device I stole and know they're<br>talking about me. But just as<br>I peek my head around the<br>corner to see what's what,<br>a searchlight grazes my cheek.<br><br><i>Crap.</i><br><br>In front of me stand massive<br>mechanical bodies twice the<br>size of a human. Their eyes<br>gleam ominously in the night<br>as they sweep the area for<br>prey. As I look, another<br>appears. Then another. Then<br>another. While they amass,<br>I creep forward as slowly as<br>possible so as not to catch<br>their attention.<br><br>So how did all this happen?<br>That's easy: because of the<br>Flowers. They appeared out of<br>the blue one day and stole<br>all of our happy lives away.<br>My wife and I, we had a son,<br>but... God, he was so young.<br><br>I volunteered to fight the<br>Flowers in an attempt to find<br>some kind of revenge, but<br>humanity still hasn't found<br>the key to victory. My wife's<br>been in low spirits lately—<br>she's clearly exhausted by all<br>the fighting—and I worry I may<br>end up losing her at this rate.<br>So that's why I decided to<br>conduct my own survey of the<br>Flowers and find a way out of<br>this no-win scenario.<br><br>As I delved into the depths<br>of the base, I managed to<br>download reams of data from a<br>computer in a classified area.<br>It was an incredible risky<br>move, but it ended up being<br>more than worth it; hidden in<br>all that data was the location<br>of something called the Flower<br>Den, which is the enemy's main<br>base. It was the kind of intel<br>that could change everything.<br><br>But before I could even process<br>what I'd found, I tripped an<br>alarm and had to make a break<br>for it. I spent so much time<br>hiding in the shadows as I made<br>my way inch by agonizing inch<br>toward the exit. And now, an<br>eternity later, I find myself<br>so very close to my goal. <br><br>I reach up and touch my pocket<br>to make sure the downloaded<br>information is still there.<br>The moment I do, a brilliant<br>white light washes over me.<br><br>"DESERTER LOCATED."<br><br>The voice is cold, and it<br>grows louder as its mechanical<br>owner moves toward my position.<br>I can't let them catch me here;<br>if they do, all of this will<br>have been for nothing.<br><br>"DROP YOUR WEAPON.<br>LIE ON THE GROUND."<br><br>Squinting under the light,<br>I put my fingers on the grip<br>of my greatsword. "All right,<br>big fella, no need to get your<br>panties in a twist. I'm not<br>going to fight back."<br><br>I toss my weapon, which<br>clatters to the floor. "There.<br>I'm unarmed. We good here?"<br><br>"APPREHENDING TARGET."<br><br>The machine moves forward,<br>ready to subdue me, but I have<br>a surprise in store. Before it<br>can grab me, I slip though its<br>legs and heave myself up and<br>onto its back, then yank the<br>cover off the base of its neck<br>and jam my device into the<br>waiting socket.<br><br>"MALWARE DETECTED.<br>COMMENCING FORCED SHUTDOWN."<br><br>See, my sword wasn't my only<br>weapon—I'd also packed a self-<br>replicating virus just in case.<br>As soon as the machine grinds<br>to a halt, I pick up my sword<br>and run as fast as my legs can<br>carry me toward the location<br>of the Flower Den. <br><br>I'm going to end this war.<br><br>I'm going to end it tonight. <br><br>I will never lose anyone<br>I care about ever again.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Exploration (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">My journey to the Flower Den<br>continues. It's a long trek,<br>but I just put my head down,<br>follow the stolen map data in<br>my device, and try to trust<br>that I know what I'm doing. <br><br>From everything I can tell,<br>the army actually brought the<br>den under our control some<br>time ago, but command didn't<br>send anyone in to investigate.<br>That strikes me as strange,<br>considering it would be the<br>perfect time to learn how the<br>Flowers live, so I intend to<br>find out for myself.<br><br>As night fades and morning<br>comes, I arrive at my<br>destination and find corpses<br>scattered throughout the area—<br>most likely the soldiers who<br>were first sent in to take the<br>place. But aside from signs of<br>an old battle, what catches my<br>attention is the building that<br>stretches into the air almost<br>beyond where I can see. Though<br>weathered and grungy, there's<br>a strangely majestic air about<br>the place, and I try to tread<br>lightly as I slip inside through<br>a shattered door.<br><br>The building is dim inside,<br>and large enough that I can't<br>see the ends of the rooms.<br>The walls are sturdy, their<br>faces lush with vines. As I<br>make my way further in, the<br>only light comes from small<br>streams of morning sunshine<br>that filter in through broken<br>windows. The hallway is a<br>never-ending stream of<br>shattered glass, splintered<br>wood, and ruble. But then...<br><br>"PLEASE. PLEASE."<br><br>I hear a woman's voice—<br>barely a whisper.<br><br>"Hello?" I ask.<br>"Is someone there?"<br><br>The only response I get from<br>the darkness is silence. As I<br>carefully proceed forward,<br>the far end of the building<br>finally comes into view.<br><br>"MERCY."<br><br>The next voice is male.<br>Multiple survivors, maybe?<br>I scan my surroundings,<br>looking for human forms,<br>when suddenly...<br><br>"Okay, what the hell?"<br><br>Resting at the far wall are a<br>series of tiny Flower sprouts.<br>The faces in the juvenile<br>petals distort in agony as they<br>attempt to speak to me.<br><br>"SALVATION."<br><br>Several voices speak at once.<br>I know this is what happens to<br>people who are consumed by<br>Flowers—they become a part of<br>the whole, unable to express<br>their own will any longer. <br><br>"They aren't human anymore,"<br>I tell myself. "They're not human,<br>dammit. They're Flowers." <br><br>The sprouts lower their petals<br>to reveal a series of twisted<br>faces. The way they droop<br>toward the ground gives the<br>impression they're praying.<br><br>"MOTHER. SAVE US, MOTHER."<br><br>After a moment, I realize the<br>Things actually are praying.<br>The subject of their reverence<br>is a dilapidated altar upon<br>which rests a grand portrait.<br>It's dirty enough that I can't<br>tell what kind of person it's<br>supposed to show, but it makes<br>my heart beat in my chest for<br>a reason I can't explain.<br><br><i>Why do I feel this way?</i><br><br>But no one is there to answer<br>my question, and the only<br>response is the continued <br>whisper of frantic prayers.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Elimination (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">"AHH. AHH. EVERYONE IS DEAD." <br><br>In the dingy building, the<br>smallest Flower sniffles.<br>A medium-sized one speaks<br>to soothe it. <br><br>"ALL IS WELL, LITTLE ONE.<br>THE MOTHER WILL SAVE US." <br><br>"THE MOTHER?<br>SHE WHO CREATED US?" <br><br>Voices of prayer fill the<br>building anew. How eerie it<br>sounds. How horrific. The ones<br>who stole happiness from me<br>and my family have no right to<br>look for salvation. <br><br>"NO. NO. NO."<br><br>I approach silently from<br>behind, cutting down the young<br>Flowers with faces. I kick<br>their remains aside and<br>approach the altar, staring<br>at the dirty portrait atop it.<br><br>"Hmm?" <br><br>I spy a book fallen behind the<br>altar. Someone's diary. It's<br>tattered, the writing faded<br>in places, but some pages<br>are still legible. <br><br>"A Flower...religion?" <br><br>I'd heard about such things<br>before. People believed the<br>Flowers would save the world,<br>and so began to worship them.<br>It seems I had found one of<br>their temples.<br><br>I carefully turn the pages so<br>as not to tear the fragile<br>paper. For a time, those who<br>worshipped the Flowers took<br>in young Flowers and lived<br>alongside them in this place.<br>But they were all eaten in the<br>end, leaving behind only a<br>mass of Flowers to continue a<br>meaningless prayer without end.<br><br>As my eyes continue to scan<br>the diary, I spot the word<br>"portrait." My hurried hands<br>come to a stop and I read,<br>transfixed.<br><br>That portrait was apparently<br>one of the religion's symbols,<br>one as revered and important<br>as the Flowers themselves.<br>But why did they find it<br>so precious?<br><br>I find my answer on the final<br>page. The people in the<br>portrait were the ones charge<br>of Flower research—the ones<br>who brought those monsters<br>into the world. Their names...<br><br>"No. I don't believe this.<br>It's <i>impossible</i>."<br><br>I walk up to the altar and<br>wipe away as much of the dirt<br>as possible. Faces slowly<br>appear from beneath the grime.<br>I'm greeted with cold, tense<br>expressions. Though the air<br>about her is different, she<br>looks <i>exactly like HER</i>.<br><br>I reel, staggering to keep<br>myself upright. As my hand<br>comes to rest on the frame,<br>I hear something fall. <br><br><i>Drip. Drip. Drip.</i><br><br>This building is a ruin; not<br>surprising that it's falling<br>apart. But as I look to the<br>ceiling, I see something<br>writhing in the dark. <br><br><i>Those are...</i><br><br>I first thought the ceiling<br>was covered in vines, but I<br>was mistaken. Instead, an<br>infinite number of juvenile<br>Flowers have tangled together<br>to create a roof.<br><br>The rush me as one, crying out<br>in voices of madness. I cut<br>them down as I run, barely<br>escaping with my life. But it<br>was all worth it, for I now<br>have evidence for the theory<br>that Flowers are sentient.<br>This data will be a huge boon<br>to our research—it might even<br>be the thread that finally<br>leads to use eliminating them<br>once and for all.<br><br>And yet, even knowing this,<br>I set fire to the church,<br>burning the Flowers and<br>erasing the portrait from<br>existence. The crimson flames<br>howl in the billowing wind.<br>They swallow the building<br>whole, reducing everything<br>within to ash and bone.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Erase (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Once I burn the church, I set<br>off on the long road back to<br>the base where my wife is<br>waiting, arriving after the<br>sun has set.<br><br>I can't get caught. I <i>can't</i>.<br>They're still after me because<br>I'm technically a deserter.<br>Cautious of my surroundings,<br>I creep back to our room.<br><br>"You're back!"<br><br>She's been waiting for me<br>the entire time, and looks<br>exhausted as she leaps from<br>her chair.<br><br>"We need to get out of here,"<br>I reply. She's bewildered,<br>but I don't wait for her to<br>start gathering our things.<br>I quickly pack the photo of<br>our son, followed by his<br>mementos. After that, I grab<br>some portable rations I'd<br>pilfered on a mission once,<br>just in case. <br><br>"Get out of here and<br>go <i>where</i>?"<br><br>"I don't know." <br><br>Her bewilderment grows<br>at my answer. <br><br>"You can't just vanish, then<br>reappear out of nowhere and<br>say we have to leave!" <br><br>I probably would have said<br>the same in her shoes. <br><br>"Okay. I'll keep this short,<br>but you have to listen." <br><br>I tell her what I saw in the<br>church. I tell her about the<br>bizarre Flower buds, the<br>altar, and the portrait.<br>The portrait of the woman who<br>looks exactly like my wife—<br>the one they call "Mother."<br><br>"Are you sure you weren't<br>dreaming?" my wife asks<br>quietly. "I mean, that's<br>just not possible."<br><br>She's right. She fights<br>against the Flowers.<br>She can't be their mother. <br><br>"The superior officers are<br>hiding something." <br><br>They must have known what was<br>in that church-turned-Flower<br>den, yet they chose not to<br>send a survey team. I can't<br>understand why; all I feel is<br>an ominous sensation gripping<br>my entire being. <br><br>"Let's go." <br><br>I zip the bag shut and hold<br>out a hand. But then...<br><br>"He has admitted to coming<br>across top-secret information." <br><br>That's all she says in return.<br>A moment later, the door<br>swings open and commanders<br>fall into place behind her. <br><br>"I believe he found it<br>sometime between the evening<br>previous and this morning.<br>But erase two days' worth of<br>memories, just in case."<br><br>"Understood." <br><br>The commanders do as<br>she says and grab me.<br><br>"Wait! Why are you—!?"<br><br><i>Ordering around commanding<br>officers? Trying to erase my<br>memory?</i> Before I can ask,<br>my mouth is gagged and I'm<br>pinned to the floor. I realize<br>my mistake then: It isn't the<br>superior officers who are<br>hiding something. <br><br>"This is for your sake,"<br>she whispers.<br><br>A cold rod stings to my neck<br>as a shock courses through my<br>body. In the instinctual fear<br>of death, my life begins<br>to flash before my eyes.<br><br>I see my wife's smile.<br><br>Her tear-streaked cheeks.<br><br>Her face colored with anger.<br><br>I thought I knew everything<br>about her, but the look on<br>her face right now is cold<br>and distant.<br><br>Just like the woman<br>in the portrait.<br><br>As the darkness swallows my<br>consciousness, I remain<br>oblivious to her intentions—<br>and her truth.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: Enthralling Love (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">A prisoner who fights Flowers<br>for revenge... Wow! That story<br>was like a movie, huh? I mean,<br>he seeks revenge for love,<br>and he falls into the pits of<br>the abyss for love, too. <br><br>Human love sure is a strange<br>thing! No matter how strong<br>or smart someone is, love<br>dulls their judgment and clouds<br>their outlook. It's almost like<br>a poison that slowly eats them<br>away from the inside, right? <br><br>But what makes the man so<br>incredible is how he can get<br>drunk off that poison.<br>Some may think that foolish,<br>but I quite like it. Heck, you<br>know me—I ADORE pure<br>humans like him!</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: The Talkative Man (No.06)</p>
<p class="para">Hey there, friend. Up for some action today? I got the cards if you got the scratch!<br><br>How's that? You think I got nothing to bet 'cause I lost to 063y? Ha! You shoulda seen the run I went on once the chips were down! I was pullin' aces outta thin air left and right, and by the end of it...<br><br>Nah, I'm kidding. Guy took me to the freaking cleaners. Did that thing where he just stares at you without moving and you can't ever tell if his hand is great or crap. But listen, here's the weird thing: After he'd taken everything but my skivvies, he stood up, grabbed a single piece of paper off the table, and walked away. Didn't even look at all the other stuff I bet.<br><br>Weird guy, right? I mean, I know paper's valuable as hell to us prisoners, but you think he woulda...<br><br>Wait, seriously? He needs the paper so he can write a letter to the missus and cheer her up? Well, ain't that a hell of a thing. Almost brings a tear to your eye.</p>
