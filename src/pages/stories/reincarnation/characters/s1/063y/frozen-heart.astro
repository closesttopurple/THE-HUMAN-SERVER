<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">A lost civilization.<br>A lost future.<br>An endless era of dulled grays and steel, devoid of the life of human activity.<br>A sole army battles an unknown enemy—the<br>Flowers—that pushes humanity to the brink of extinction.<br>The soldiers in this army are called prisoners.<br>Their acts and very thoughts are placed under supervision.<br>Among them, a man once fought on the front lines.<br>Much was expected of his battle prowess. But now he sits<br>imprisoned and locked in a cell of a secret base.<br>He was captured by a resistance organization comprised of soldiers who were<br>branded as defectives by the army after they developed their own wills.<br>A woman—a member of this organization—interrogates him.<br>They were both once soldiers who fought the Flowers.<br>But now they have no choice but to stand opposed,<br>all because of their philosophical differences beyond their struggle with the Flowers.<br>The woman bombards the man, her enemy, with question after question.<br>Though it is your duty to slaughter the Flowers,<br>is it not foolish to serve those who value your life so little?<br>Hearing this, the man gives a simple response.<br>All fights are foolish. I have nothing to protect, nor have I had anything taken from me.<br>He would surely be punished if his superior officer heard this, but his feelings are genuine.<br>The Flowers have put humanity in a dreadful predicament.<br>If they do not fight back, the world will meet its swift end.<br>He understands this. He knows better than most that humanity must fight.<br>But deep down...<br>From his own perspective, he has no particular reasons to hate the Flowers.<br>If they were to take his child, he would not rest a single moment.<br>If they were to take his wife, wrath would consume him.<br>But the man's heart has no such intrinsic dignity or attachment.<br>He is simply given his missions quickly and quietly.<br>And because he has no reason to run, he fights as he is told.<br>Fighting...<br>Fighting is always foolish.<br>The woman is taken aback by the man's remark, having expected rigid words of loyalty.<br>You fought as a proper soldier. Did you ever question the ways of the army?<br>Her question is dubious.<br>I have never questioned or opposed. I don't care one way<br>or another about the army, the Flowers, or the world.<br>He gives an honest answer.<br>The army was not watching, after all. What good would lying do?<br>Though his cold answer bewilders her, the woman continues.<br>I assume that means you have no interest in Resistance activities.<br>Of course not, he replies curtly.<br>If he received a direct military order to contend with the<br>Resistance, he surely would have done so.<br>But given that he cannot be issued orders in his current<br>predicament, he has no reason to defy the woman before him.<br>This bewilders her all the more.<br>Every one of your companions has voiced their hatred of the Flowers.<br>You're the odd man out.<br>She gives a faint smile, though she may not even realize it.<br>Her smile stirs distant memories in him.<br>This is their first time meeting, and yet her face is so familiar.<br>More than familiar—it's almost like the two had once shared smiles together.<br>Her smile is a gentle ray of sunlight, and in its warmth there is no need to fight, no others to worry about.<br>But when the man voices his honest thoughts, the woman replies,<br>"We have never met. Both you and I have spent our days fighting the Flowers."<br>A cold, callous voice.<br>But she is correct. His sentimentality was simply a delusion.<br>The man is surprised to discover such a common emotion inside of him.<br>He's not sure whether or not the woman picks up on his confusion.<br>Seducing your interrogator? Maybe you're the odd one.<br>There is delight in her smile.<br>A smile so kind, and so pretty...<br><i>I'd love to talk with her more</i>, he thinks.<br>It is his honest thought.<br>For the man who never questioned his daily struggle against the Flowers, yet lived<br>without a hint of hatred toward them, this is the first time he<br>has ever shown any interest in another person.<br>The time he has found freedom.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Humanity lost nearly everything with the sudden appearance of the Flowers.<br>The army placed their soldiers under its absolute control to eliminate the Flowers,<br>carrying out warfare day in and day out to wrest the planet from the enemy's grasp.<br>Of them, one man was captured by the Resistance—an organization that broke away from the army.<br>He thinks back on his time fighting on the frontlines.<br>His battlefield prowess was unparalleled. He was granted cutting-edge weaponry in the war against the<br>Flowers and placed in a facility with the most advanced medical technology.<br>But he was not free.<br>Combat training was his life. Eliminating the enemy took precedent in all things.<br>Until the moment his body gave out, he would fight to whittle down the Flowers' numbers even slightly.<br>It was the daily routine the army gave him, and his only reward was the permission to keep living.<br>It was expected. Natural.<br>Ironically, he only began questioning his life when he came to learn of the Resistance.<br>Though labeled defectives after attaining free will and rebelling against the army,<br>though the world itself concluded they were superfluous, they were determined to live their own lives.<br>They made him consider what it meant to be free.<br>Where does the satisfaction of freedom come from?<br>The man is now a prisoner of the Resistance and his actions are, of course, quite limited.<br>It was not his intention to get captured.<br>But he does not feel restricted in his predicament. If anything, it stirs a curiosity in him.<br>He does not sense a righteous conviction in the Resistance woman who questioned him.<br>And yet, he sensed her profound fixation on the pursuit of freedom.<br><i>Is it not foolish to serve those who value your life so little?</i><br>She had spoken plainly.<br>Those are the words that define him, the man believes—the words he has been looking for.<br>As luck would have it, he is given another opportunity to speak with the woman.<br>The woman approached him several more times since his first interrogation,<br>and they would speak of their lives every time they met.<br>By appearance, they couldn't be more different. But they quickly realize their ways of thinking align.<br>It did not take long for their feelings for one another to grow amicable.<br>It seems we seek the same thing, do we not? the woman asks, her tone serene.<br>I'd say so. We've got the same things on our minds, and we're looking for the same things.<br>The man answers matter-of-factly.<br>He does not yet know if they are truly one and the same.<br>And yet...<br>Even when their chats were discordant or not entirely factual, they were genuinely delightful.<br>The man laughs and smiles so often when they are alone together<br>that his life before feels like a distant dream. The woman smiles much the same way.<br>I never thought I could click with someone else through conversation before.<br>I never thought I'd be so interested in another person.<br>One conversation leads to another as though they are comparing answers.<br>They cannot be so optimistic as to hope for a blissful future.<br>But above all else, the man feels bliss in being alive,<br>in having the chance to share in the woman's feelings.<br>And yet...<br>He will soon learn their pleasure is short-lived.<br>One day, time on his hands without the daily routine of war, the man takes a small device he<br>kept hidden on his person and uses it in an attempt to access the Resistance's data.<br>He had no intention of causing harm—he simply wanted to know more about the woman.<br>He assumed he could extract data from Resistance servers and<br>impress the woman with information she had not yet mentioned.<br>However...<br>What he finds there is information that he—that any mere soldier—is best off never knowing.<br>He learns that the military uses cloning for soldiers.<br>That he and the woman are a cloned pair, modeled after an existing couple.<br>When a clone is born from the cultivation tubes, they are implanted<br>with memories of being married and having lost a child, and then deployed into battle.<br>A love beyond all reason, and the shared pain of having lost an innocent child.<br>Such soldiers would never question the reasons behind why they fought.<br>But with each iteration, that system began exhibiting errors.<br>This man was born as little more than a man, and the woman little more than a woman.<br>They had been placed in separate bases so that they would never meet,<br>and experimentally implanted with different memories.<br>But as fate would have it, they were brought together all the same.<br>Feelings were born within the man for the woman who was meant to be his wife.<br>Data on the Resistance server had not even been encrypted. The defective<br>woman must have known that the two of them were once predetermined family.<br>She knew this, and used it. Or perhaps it was because of the very fact that she was defective.<br>She placated him, knowing he would come to harbor feelings for her,<br>and instilled in him a freedom she could manipulate.<br>Indeed, her goodwill was all a lie.<br>All that blissful time they shared was a lie.<br>Upon learning the truth, the man is shocked.<br>So great is his despair, he can scarcely control it.<br>He can no longer stay here.<br>He grits his teeth and makes a decision in anguish:<br>He will escape this place that separates him from a fate far more wicked and cruel.<br>His true freedom depends on it.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The man who fights the Flowers decides to opens his heart to the<br>Resistance woman who captured him.<br>In his captivity, he finds freedom for the first time.<br>He finds bliss in the time he spends with her.<br>But it is all a lie.<br>He finds data on the Resistance servers.<br>He learns the truth—he and the woman are clones, implanted with<br>memories of being a couple who lost their child, and made to fight as the army commands.<br>The man now realizes: The woman knew all of this, and she feigned friendliness to placate him.<br>In his disappointment and despair, he makes up his mind—he must escape this place.<br>One day, fighting breaks out between the army and the Resistance.<br>The man grasps this golden opportunity to leave the Resistance base.<br>Other Resistance members do not chase him far.<br>They are few in numbers to begin with.<br>Evidently, the Resistance cannot spare a single member to track<br>down an escaped prisoner when the fighting gets serious.<br>His escape is an easy one.<br>He will surely find his way back to the army base if he keeps running.<br>But there is one person who has stuck to his trail.<br>The defective woman. She alone has pursued the man.<br>Panicked by his absence, she set off in search of him to set him<br>right without having to rely on the help of her comrades.<br>Her breath is ragged as she stands before him, pointing a gun.<br>The distant affection lingering in him pangs.<br>She was using his feelings against him.<br>And now, it seems she insists on killing him by her own hand.<br>How lively their conversations once were. But now, there is only silence.<br>A dry, desolate wind blows between them.<br>The man pushes down the stinging sorrow in his chest and points his own gun at her.<br>He rests his finger on the trigger to rid himself of these pointless emotions that drag on endlessly.<br>But then, he notices something unusual in the woman's face.<br>Tears stream down her face. But it is not from the fear of death.<br>Her jaw is clenched, her fingers quiver, her brows knit in perplexity—in truth, they are tears of sadness.<br>Weren't you using me to your own ends?<br>The man questions her tears.<br>I was. I used your fate <i>and</i> my own so that I could be free.<br>As though ridding herself of the trauma burned into her heart, she continues speaking her truth.<br>Once she was disposed of as defective, and after the<br>Resistance took her in, she learned that she was a clone.<br>She felt as though her whole life, her whole <i>being</i> was<br>rendered into nothing, and she fell into despair.<br>Though she was once a soldier who fought the Flowers, she no could no<br>longer hold onto the motivation to<br>fight, becoming nothing more than a weak human who did no battle.<br>The world had no need for her, yet she still desired life. And so she sought a future in which she could live.<br>The Resistance's cause hardly resonated with her. And yet she<br>devoted herself to her work so that she could make a place for herself.<br>And then one day, they captured a man.<br>She knew they were created to be a married couple—their compatibility was all but guaranteed.<br>She believed she could easily manipulate him into giving up information.<br>She did her work as usual, protecting the niche she carved out for herself.<br>For a time, things went just as planned.<br>But the feelings she had for him slumbering in the depths of her<br>mind arose with more power than she ever imagined.<br>As she tried to win him over to their side, she enjoyed the conversations they shared,<br>she sympathized with his thoughts and opinions, and ultimately fell deeply in love with him.<br>She knew it was false. Things were unfolding according to this terrible fate,<br>though she thought she could run from it.<br>I couldn't fight the feelings, she declares.<br>Tears well from her eyes.<br>When the man hears this, he knows.<br>He too has feelings he cannot fight.<br>Is there any point to fighting them?<br>Inevitably, he cannot find one.<br>He simply need follow them.<br>Making up his mind, he lowers his gun.<br>He fearlessly steps toward her in spite of the barrel pointed at him and speaks softly.<br>Even if everything is a lie, I still want to live my life with you.<br>His honest feelings are at once predictable and genuine.<br>They are not married, nor parents, but strangers.<br>Even if their spark was nothing but fabricated memories, the desire to remain together is real.<br>The woman lowers her gun with trembling hands.<br>Tears continue to stream down her face.<br>The man extends a hand to her.<br>Let's run away. It doesn't matter where.<br>We're getting out of this world that's hell-bent on using us.<br>She gives a firm nod to his invitation.<br>And so begins their escape journey.<br>The feelings they share for each other are their only truth.<br>And by their own hands, they will find true freedom.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">A pair of clones created to be family.<br>Through ill-starred fate, they met, fell in love,<br>and decided to run away together.<br>Away from the world that wished to toy with their hearts.<br>Years go by.<br>Neither of them have returned to the military<br>base or the Resistance hideout.<br>They live quiet, modest lives scattered<br>across lands far from civilization.<br>Their lives are neither leisurely nor dignified,<br>but they understood this the moment they decided to run.<br>They knew they were not long for this world.<br>They knew their deaths were not far off.<br>I'm sorry for dragging you along on this life.<br>The man speaks with dry, aged lips.<br>There's no need to apologize. I'm the one who chose to go with you.<br>The woman's lips are similarly parched, but they smile in return.<br>They know it, understand it, accept it.<br>They know they are inferior clones of an original pair.<br>The makeup of their bodies is not the same as that of a pure human.<br>Without the military's newest bespoke maintenance routines and provisions,<br>their physical bodies and organs cannot sustain function.<br>In essence, neither can live life to their satisfaction so long as<br>they remain free. In a few years' time, their lives will cease.<br>Chronologically, they are not even twenty years old.<br>And unlike what their false memories recalled, they never had a child.<br>Though their background was that of a married couple,<br>they were never given reproductive organs in the first place.<br>This world does not want them to be parents.<br>Life is hardly necessary in a world that battles the Flowers.<br>Yet they chose to be life partners, to become that married couple.<br>They were not forced into marriage—they chose it.<br>At the end of their journey, there are no other humans there to bless their relationship.<br>There are no other living beings at all.<br>Wherever they live, wherever they visit, there are no children.<br>The world's struggle against the growing forces of the Flowers goes on,<br>and the army loses soldier lives and creates new ones every day.<br>Both the man and the woman once fought against the Flowers.<br>But victory for humanity is not their goal, so they evade the Flowers entirely.<br>They have no reason to fight, so they have no need to engage.<br>They will leave behind no legacy, and they do not fight to protect anything—they simply live.<br>In the eyes of the army and the Resistance both, they live useless, lonely, and empty lives.<br>Nor will they ever have the chance for a glorious death in battle.<br>This world is in ruins. Its condition will only worsen, and there is no truth worth rejoicing in.<br>There are only the faintest rays of light.<br>The man could have lived a full life if he remained in the army under strict supervision.<br>He would have met and fallen in love with another woman, living his life to protect her.<br>Perhaps that mundane life would have been ideal for him.<br>Yet both he and <i>this</i> woman acted of their own will,<br>joined together in matrimony of their own will, and they regret nothing.<br>They often have questions, certainly.<br>How are the other clones faring? What about the ones who birthed them?<br>Perhaps they have found satisfaction in their own ways, but the man and the woman<br>believe they are more free than those people will ever be.<br>Painful though it is, they accept this death.<br>Difficult though it is, this is the life they wish to share together.<br><i>This</i> is the true essence of freedom, they believe.<br>No matter how things end, we will face it together. So long as I'm with you,<br>I can find happiness anywhere.<br>The man speaks gently, his body weakened.<br>We will be together to our last breath. So long as I'm with you,<br>I can accept whatever awaits us.<br>The woman speaks warmly, her brittle bones creaking.<br>A lost civilization. A lost future.<br>An endless era of dulled grays and steel, devoid of the life of human activity.<br>The only sound is that of their own voices. No legacy<br>will remain to recount the path they walked.<br>翻訳待ち</p>
