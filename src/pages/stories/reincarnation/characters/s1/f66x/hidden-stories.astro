<p class="title">Chapter 1: Change (My) Life (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">The only sounds in the empty<br>room are a metronomic beeping<br>and the quiet breathing of my<br>husband. He is bound to the<br>bed, his entire body wired to<br>a machine that controls his<br>body temperature, heart rate,<br>and all other life functions.<br>Next to him, a young officer<br>speaks softly to me.<br><br>"He acquired confidential<br>information again, Commander.<br>This is his eighth instance<br>of unauthorized access to<br>such intelligence.”<br><br>As she speaks, details of my<br>husband's previous infractions<br>appear on a nearby wall screen.<br>I'm not surprised; it's always<br>been like this. Whenever he<br>sees a chance, he breaks into<br>some area deep within the base<br>and steals classified data<br>about the Flowers. <br><br>"I'm sorry, Commander, but I<br>can't cover for him any more.”<br><br><i>Commander</i>. The word stings<br>my ears. I hate being called by<br>that title around my husband,<br>even though he's not awake to<br>hear it.<br><br>It wasn't always like this.<br>But one day, the Flowers<br>attacked our world and<br>everything changed. Humanity<br>is yet to find a key to<br>victory; if anything, we fade<br>a little more each time the<br>sun rises on a new day.<br>We've lost so many now:<br>soldiers, prisoners, and yes,<br>even commanders. The Flowers<br>have taken them all. But the<br>lack of people in leadership<br>positions is our most pressing<br>concern, so the people in<br>charge attempted to solve it<br>with a most novel solution: <br><br>They promoted prisoners.<br><br>Prisoners like me.<br><br>The job of a commander is to<br>manage and control the rest<br>of the prisoners. So when<br>news of my own promotion came,<br>I knew instantly that I would<br>have to send my own husband<br>off into the jaws of death.<br>I couldn't bear to share that<br>with him, so I attempted to<br>keep it a secret and live my<br>life just as I always had—<br>until the day he broke into<br>the base and first stole<br>confidential information.<br><br>We have rules for people who<br>do such things. The punishment<br>is very swift—and very final.<br>But instead of putting him to<br>death, I used the privileges<br>of command to keep him alive.<br>I ordered the classified<br>information deleted from his<br>memories, and we returned to<br>our normal lives. I thought I<br>could somehow keep this up—<br>that I could keep lying to<br>everyone about what I was now.<br>And I might have done it,<br>except that my husband stole<br>classified information again.<br><br>And again.<br><br>And <i>again</i>.<br><br>The irony is almost too much<br>to bear: The reason he risked<br>death to find some path to<br>victory against the Flowers<br>was because he wanted to<br>protect <i>me</i>. But now,<br>once again, it is my turn to<br>protect him.<br><br>"Prepare for memory deletion,”<br>I say to the officer. When she<br>doesn't move, I slowly turn my<br>head to look at her. "That is<br>a direct order.”<br><br>"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I<br>cannot comply.”<br><br>Her quiet voice rattles in<br>my ears. "What did you say?” <br><br>"Your husband should have been<br>eliminated after his first<br>transgression, but you used<br>your authority to delete his<br>memories and protect him.<br>I've stood by as you did so<br>again and again, but I can<br>abide it no longer.”<br><br>She goes on to tell me that<br>my actions are not as secret<br>as I thought—other commanders<br>are aware of what I have been<br>doing, and they are displeased<br>to say the least. If it does<br>not stop, they will deem me<br>unfit for command and dispose<br>of me in the way all useless<br>prisoners are dealt with. <br><br>"I didn't ask for this,”<br>I whisper. "I didn't ask<br>for any of it.”<br><br>And it's true. I didn't.<br>I didn't care for the power<br>of command, or the honor,<br>or the ceremonial trappings.<br>The only thing I cared about<br>was protecting the man I love.<br><br>"You have to stop this,” says<br>the officer. "We have plans<br>in motions, great plans that<br>may finally turn the tide of<br>this war and give you the<br>revenge you seek. Would you<br>really throw all of that away?”<br><br>She takes my hand and places<br>it gently atop the machine.<br>"If you turn this off,<br>his vitals will cease to<br>function. He'll just...go to<br>sleep. Quickly. Peacefully.<br>But we're running out of time,<br>Commander, and we need you to<br>make a decision.”<br><br>Her quiet voice is a faint echo<br>in the empty room.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Change (Your) Love (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">The leisurely beeping that<br>disturbs the quiet of the<br>living room tells me the water<br>is boiling. I get up from my<br>chair and head to the kitchen,<br>where I take out an assortment<br>of snacks and prepare my tea.<br><br>Treatment like this was nigh<br>unthinkable when I was a low-<br>ranking soldier—or to be more<br>blunt, a prisoner with a<br>slightly more palatable title.<br>But now I own a first-class<br>apartment with a guest room—<br>don't know when I'll be using<br>that—and a constant supply of<br>luxuries like sweets and tea. <br><br>Yes, my life certainly became<br>enriched when I took on the<br>position of a superior officer.<br>But every day I wake up and ask<br>myself what the point is to<br>having such wealth.<br>What even is the point?<br><br>I glance over at the framed<br>photograph in the center of<br>the living room, the one<br>showing a smiling image of<br>my husband. He was my rock.<br>My light. The person I loved<br>more than anything.<br><br>And the person I killed.<br><br>Pressured by command, I made<br>the decision to turn off my<br>husband's life support,<br>abandoning what was most<br>precious to me for the benefit<br>of the base. As a result,<br>my subordinates found renewed<br>confidence in me, and my<br>superiors praised my loyalty.<br>But this brings me right back<br>around to the same question I<br>always ask: What's the point?<br>What is the goddamn point?<br><br>I briefly considered following<br>my husband into the afterlife,<br>but couldn't do it. The shrewd<br>watch of my commanders played<br>a part in that decision,<br>but ultimately, I couldn't<br>abandon my plan to end the<br>Flowers once and for all. <br><br>Blowing steam across my mug,<br>I press a few buttons on a<br>small screen on the kitchen<br>counter and pull up footage<br>from a surveillance camera. <br>Children's voices come through,<br>as well as the shrill bark<br>of an overseer.<br><br>"Get in line, all of you!" <br><br>"Kay!"<br><br>There are countless prisoners<br>exhausted by this never-ending<br>war with the Flowers—and our<br>recent rise in deserters is<br>proof. But I've come up with<br>a plan to give even the lowest<br>soldier a reason to fight.<br>Want to hear it? It's a doozy.<br><br>See, I proposed we implant<br>prisoners with memories of<br>having children, then supply<br>them with <i>actual</i> children<br>to protect. I figured I'd face<br>an uphill battle—or be laughed<br>out of the room entirely—but<br>to my shock, command not only<br>approved the plan, they<br>supplied the children that I<br>needed to make it work. <br>The little moppets now live<br>in a care center in the base,<br>giving the prisoners who are<br>their “parents” a reason keep<br>fighting in the outside world.<br><br>The irony just <i>kills</i> me.<br><br>My own son was killed by the<br>Flowers, is the thing—and the<br>animosity born from that<br>memory is what kept me alive<br>all this time. The pain of the<br>loss is a set of teeth on my<br>heart as fresh as the day it<br>happened, so the fact I'm<br>using that same pain to help<br>my former companions rush<br>headlong into death is...<br><br>Well, it's monstrous.<br><i>Monstrous.</i><br><br>But now that I've chosen this<br>path, there's no turning back.<br>I have to destroy the Flowers<br>and have my revenge, because—<br><br>“I'm hooome! What's my snack?”<br> <br>A small figure rushes into the<br>living room, and I shake myself<br>free from my reverie as I turn<br>to him. “You have something<br>to do before snack time, yes?”<br><br>His face lights up as he<br>rushes to the most prominent<br>place in the living room:<br>the memorial for my husband.<br>The boy takes the photograph<br>and holds it reverently in<br>both of his tiny hands. <br><br>“I'm home, Dad!”<br><br>God, his eyes remind me<br><i>so</i> much of him...</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Change (His) Life (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">In my position as a senior officer,<br>I've led countless projects to<br>completion—not just the one<br>that keeps soldiers from<br>deserting. We've also mapped<br>Flower dens around the planet,<br>performed research into their<br>ecology, and developed a host<br>of new weapons. Though we've<br>yet to exterminate the enemy,<br>humanity has stepped back<br>from the brink, and is now in<br>the process of putting itself<br>together again.<br><br>"Sorry we took so long, Mom." <br><br>I turn to find my son walking<br>into the officer's lounge.<br>He's grown over the years,<br>and is now more a man than<br>the little boy I remembered.<br><br>"Thank you for taking the<br>time to be here," I say. <br><br>A woman steps out from behind<br>my son, her wide eyes boring<br>deep into my own.<br><br>"Uh, so, Mom? This is my<br>girlfriend. I think I...<br>mentioned her?" <br><br>His bashful introduction<br>causes me to chuckle.<br><br>"Hello, ma'am," she says.<br>"My name is ———, and I work<br>in the research division." <br><br>The introduction is sweet,<br>but unnecessary; I already<br>know everything there is to<br>know about her. Her name,<br>age, job, time of birth—every<br>moment of her life is at my<br>fingertips. Yet I manage to<br>put on an expression of<br>ignorance and listen to the<br>rest of her introduction. <br><br>"I'm pleased to have met you<br>today," I say when she's done.<br>Our chat is short, but pleasant<br>enough, and I'm happy to see<br>how tactfully she handles<br>her time in the spotlight.<br>But then, at the moment<br>when my son is <i>supposed</i><br>to ease us out of the awkward<br>silence that follows introductions,<br>he blurts out:<br><br>"You two are kind of similar." <br><br>"Similar?" asks his girlfriend.<br>"You mean me and your mother?" <br><br>"Yeah. Like, I dunno.<br>The vibes you give off." <br><br>My mouth twists wryly at that.<br>"Saying your girlfriend<br>reminds you of your mother is<br>the worst possible thing you<br>could say, Son. If she never<br>speaks to you again, I'll<br>fully support her decision." <br><br>An awkward expression crosses<br>my son's face, which causes<br>his girlfriend to burst out<br>laughing. The tension eased<br>at last, they give brief<br>farewells and leave the<br>lounge. As I watch them go,<br>a small sigh rises in my<br>heart. A moment later, my<br>commander arrives and places<br>a hot drink before me. <br><br>"Thank you," I murmur quietly.<br>The tea is just warm enough<br>not to burn. She knows exactly<br>what I like—no surprise,<br>seeing as we've been mostly<br>inseparable ever since I rose<br>up to the position of senior officer.<br>Perhaps that's why she feels<br>comfortable enough to look me<br>in the eye and say: <br><br>"How does it feel to have<br>your husband introduce his<br>girlfriend to you?" <br><br>Ah, she's always like this.<br>She seems cold and emotionless<br>most of the time, but in truth,<br>she finds nothing more<br>delightful than pushing<br>people's buttons.<br><br>"He is my <i>son</i> now." <br><br>Here's the thing: Once I<br>learned that management<br>possessed the technology to<br>create clones, I used my<br>husband's stored genetic data<br>to make one, then took him out<br>of the incubator while he was<br>still a baby. This was only<br>done to protect him; if he<br>were to mature there and have<br>my husband's old memories<br>implanted, he'd only make the<br>same mistake of accessing top-<br>secret data all over again.<br><br>"And what about <i>her</i>?<br>Does she meet expectations?" <br><br>"Not in the slightest." <br><br>"Why not? She has a stellar<br>reputation, and seems<br>extremely well-tempered." <br><br>"It's not a question of<br>character. Her performance<br>is simply too average." <br><br>This is true. The girl has<br>shown no aptitude for science,<br>and seems content to remain a<br>lowly, anonymous researcher.<br>She's nothing like me, which<br>means she is no proper match<br>for <i>him</i>.<br><br>I lean back and close my eyes.<br>Bringing up an image of her<br>smiling face, I mentally<br>scrawl a red X across it.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Changeling (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Something rocks me, stirring<br>me from sleep. When I open my<br>eyes, I'm greeted by a bright,<br>false sun and the familiar<br>sight of my commander's face.<br><br>"He's crying. Should you<br>attend to him?" <br><br>She jerks her chin toward a<br>small crib, where I hear a<br>baby's disgruntled mumbling.<br><br>"Oh, yes. Thank you. Goodness,<br>my hearing has gotten worse as<br>I've grown older; I used to<br>leap out of bed at the<br>slightest sound when my<br>son was a baby!"<br><br>I lift the baby into my arms<br>and look into his eyes. "You<br>were sleeping so soundly,<br>little one. What do you need?<br>A diaper change? Milk?" <br><br>As I rock the little guy in<br>my arms to calm him down,<br>a smile cracks across my<br>commander's face. It isn't a<br>warm, fond smile, but a cold<br>and pitying one. <br><br>"He looks so much like you."<br><br>"You think so?" I reply<br>quietly, pretending not to<br>hear the thorns in her speech.<br><br>"But I suppose he would.<br>The father is your husb...<br>Apologies. Your <i>son</i>. And the<br>mother is your clone too." <br><br>She's correct. Around the time<br>I created my husband's clone,<br>I made a dozen clones of<br>myself. I altered some so they<br>didn't look exactly like me,<br>then removed them from the<br>incubators and gave them to<br>prisoners who could serve as<br>suitable parents.<br><br>"I'm surprised it went so<br>well. Was every girl your<br>son dated your clone?"<br><br>All my clones had been raised<br>in varying environments,<br>which means they show their<br>uniqueness in different ways.<br>Some are excellent workers<br>with brilliant talent. Some<br>are average. Some dropouts. <br><br>"His mother is quiet and seems<br>average at a glance, but she<br>has an analytical mind."<br><br>Those who are quiet and tend<br>to have subdued emotions are<br>often more colorful with those<br>they're comfortable with. <br><br>"She's family-oriented," my<br>commander says, her tone as<br>flat as if she's reading from<br>a document. "Your son's wife<br>is almost exactly like you,<br>from her skill set to her<br>personality—and to a rather<br>shocking degree."<br><br>I'd spent decades carefully<br>putting this project into<br>motion just for this moment.<br>I sent my clones to my son so<br>they would meet, made sure<br>they dated, then encouraged<br>them to have children.<br><br>"Do you think me odd?"<br>I ask suddenly.<br><br>My commander nods. "I do.<br>However, I don't think it's<br>a bad thing. This is the<br>happiest I've ever seen you." <br><br>My son has been taken from me.<br>My husband is lost. But now,<br>at long last, I finally have<br>it all back. This child was<br>born from a clone of my<br>husband and my own clone. <br>it is my—<i>our</i>— true son. <br><br>I look down and realize the<br>grumpy, crying baby has<br>finally begun to snore<br>softly in my arms.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: Idol of the Holy Mother (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">She needs the support of her family in her fight with the<br>Flowers. This is why she holds her husband and son so dear. <br><br>Look at all she has. So many memories. Not just photographs,<br>but sketches, letters—even scribbles. She keeps each and<br>every last one. They serve as her proof.<br><br>...Yes, it is natural she remembers her husband in this way.<br>However, it <i>is</i> strange that she keeps mementos of<br>her ■■■■■■■■■ son. You are correct in that.<br><br>But they say a woman's prayer will pierce the most stalwart<br>of stones. If she believes this is her truth, it will one<br>day <i>become</i> her truth. <br><br>The mementos are there to help her keep her story straight.<br>They are tools to make her believe she had a son—tools to<br>help her play the role of mother. <br><br>So please, be kind to her. Watch over her. Especially when<br>it comes time for her to learn the truth and choose her path.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 6: The Chatty Woman (No.06)</p>
<p class="para">Ugh. I hate getting assigned<br>to expeditions. Prep takes<br>forever, and we're all pretty<br>much guaranteed to die anyway.<br>I don't get why we have to lug<br>all this crap around, and...<br><br>Wait, F66x is with us this<br>time? Oh, that's even worse!<br>Okay, so listen. She's got,<br>like, a wall around her, you<br>know? We were in the same<br>unit last time, and she never<br>said a word more than she<br>absolutely needed to—I mean,<br>not a word! It was impossible<br>to get to know her. I mean,<br>does the chick even smile?<br><br>...Huh? I should ask her about<br>her husband? The hell does that<br>mean? ...Uh-huh. ...Uh-huh.<br>...Wait, so she's head over heels<br>for him and gets all chatty<br>whenever he comes up?<br><br>Heh. That's adorable, actually.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 7: A Mother's Journal (No.07)</p>
<p class="para"><i>Growing Up</i><br><br>He walks on his own now.<br>But he always tumbles backwards.<br>I guess his head is too big. <br><br>He can't produce actual words,<br>but from how he babbles I can<br>only assume he's trying to talk<br>to me. He knows how to gesture<br>hello and goodbye, and he's<br>starting to understand what<br>I'm saying. <br><br>He's getting bigger and has<br>more lung capacity, so now his<br>nighttime crying fits are more like<br>screaming fits. And that means<br>I'm always running on low sleep...<br><br>I still don't know what I'm doing<br>raising this kid, and there are<br>plenty of days where I hate<br>everything because I'm so busy.<br>But when I see how the shape<br>of his eyes looks exactly like<br><i>his</i>, I feel my energy<br>rushing back to me. <br><br>I never, ever in my wildest dreams<br>imagined that something so<br>precious could exist on<br>this planet.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 8: Data on Promotion Standards (No.08)</p>
<p class="para">Re: Standards for Individuals<br>Suited for Promotion to<br>Officer and Command Positions<br><br>Basic capabilities should be<br>higher than average, as well<br>as a logical decision-making<br>ability. Ask yourself, could<br>this individual sacrifice one<br>to permit ten to live?<br><br>However, taking historic data<br>into consideration, we cannot<br>claim that judgments made out<br>of rationality alone are<br>always correct. Actual records<br>shows that superior officers<br>who place too much value on<br>efficiency and push for<br>perfection in battle and<br>experiments are often the<br>subjects of mutiny among<br>soldiers (i.e. prisoners), and<br>sometimes perish as a result.<br><br>She is the only one we can<br>think of who prioritizes<br>rationality, yet can also keep<br>dissent from the lowest ranks<br>to a minimum. Though merciful,<br>she is driven by revenge,<br>and we are confident she is<br>willing to sacrifice others<br>to achieve that end.<br><br>We do believe there is a<br>chance her husband—another<br>prisoner—may warp her<br>judgment. However, we are<br>planning to deal with that<br>matter separately. If this<br>goes well, we are confident <br>she will prove to be the<br>perfect superior officer.</p>

Oh, you're very welcome!<br>The fight was easy—didn't take<br>much extra work at all to pick<br>these up! Still, you sure are<br>getting a lot more children<br>over at the center, huh?<br>How many caretakers do<br>you have now?<br><br>Fifteen including you? Whoa,<br>that's a <i>lot</i>!
