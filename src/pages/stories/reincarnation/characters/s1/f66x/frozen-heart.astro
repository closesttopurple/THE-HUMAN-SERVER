<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">Ferocious man-eating Flowers threaten the very existence of humanity.<br>Soldiers known as "prisoners" face the Flowers in brutal,<br>deadly battle day in and day out.<br>One day...<br>A particular frontline base suffered catastrophic damage<br>after a large-scale Flower attack.<br>The only survivors were a prisoner couple—a man and a woman.<br>The Flowers had taken their precious child's life,<br>and they fought to avenge him.<br>The battle ended in utter defeat for the base.<br>Their fellow prisoners were mercilessly slaughtered.<br>But all was not lost.<br>Wrath boiled inside of them.<br>The couple had not forgotten about their revenge.<br>They <i>will</i> pay.<br>And together, we will eliminate them.<br>Though the Flowers destroyed most of the base's facilities,<br>not all of its functions ceased.<br>Miraculously, the bare minimum of supplies remained.<br>And so together, the couple begins repairing the base<br>in preparation to fight the Flowers once more.<br>We need to do something about these seeds first.<br>They've jammed up all the equipment.<br>The Flowers scattered the seeds during their attack.<br>They will continue to grow and hamper the restoration<br>of the base until the day they awaken.<br>If the seeds aren't dealt with quickly,<br>young Flowers will bud and grow rampant.<br>In such an event, the Flowers would trample the base from the inside,<br>bringing an inevitable and total defeat.<br>It's the one scenario they want to avoid at all costs.<br>The couple ventures deep into the base,<br>doing all they can to remove seeds from every nook and cranny.<br>It's backbreaking work, but not once do they voice a complaint.<br>Amidst their intensive yet critical work,<br>the wife finds a corridor she's never seen before.<br>It's likely a consequence of the partial destruction of the base.<br>Things that were once completely obscured are now plainly visible.<br>What is this? The two exchange looks, quietly nod,<br>then cautiously make their way down the corridor.<br>They come to the deepest part of the base.<br>In the center of the room is a console,<br>and on the opposite side, a massive door.<br>Thanks to the room being so deep within the base,<br>it suffered no damage from the Flower attack<br>and retains the full scope of its functions.<br>The woman accesses the console and quickly skims over the data within.<br>It seems to be quite a large database. However...<br>No communication functions? Was this device cut off from the network?<br>Standing before them is an apparatus that does not send<br>nor receive information, but rather, it is a vessel for storing it.<br>But why? To what end? Though doubt lingers in their minds,<br>the couple continues to fiddle with the console and studies its data.<br>They quickly understand.<br>They understand why this device and its data were<br>in use despite being isolated from the network.<br>What unfolds before them is the genetic information of the Flowers,<br>something long considered a mystery.<br>Not a word of this was mentioned to the prisoners.<br>This information is as confidential as can be.<br>This data could very well be key to eliminating<br>the Flower seeds effectively and definitively.<br>But it has even greater implications.<br>With a thorough analysis of the genetic data,<br>they might be able to find a way to eradicate the Flowers entirely.<br>The wife trembles with excitement.<br>It's as though the data is divine intervention.<br>Their revenge may well be within their grasp.<br>But then, the husband speaks.<br>Why didn't they tell anyone about such critical information?<br>Why hide it away here?<br>The woman nods in agreement.<br>Her husband is right.<br>With data like this, the development of weapons effective<br>against the Flowers would have been possible.<br>Someone must have been plotting something.<br>Perhaps a greater secret is hidden somewhere in this base?<br>In search of further information, the couple decides<br>to venture beyond the great door on the other side of the room.<br>It's a place the officers kept hidden away from the prisoners.<br>And there...<br>They find the massive corpse of a Flower.<br>It floats in what appears to be a water tank,<br>and several cables connect to it.<br>And all around it...<br>Are these...humans?<br>Hundreds of clear capsules are filled<br>with liquid and peacefully sleeping human bodies.<br>At a loss for words, the couple immediately understands<br>the significance of the shocking sight.<br>They are human, and yet they are not.<br>They are manufactured beings.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">A prisoner couple were the sole survivors of a ferocious Flower attack.<br>They ventured into the core of their base in search of a way<br>to rid the base of Flower seeds.<br>It was there they found a well-preserved Flower corpse.<br>And with it, tanks of manufactured humans.<br>Before them stretch rows of countless clones.<br>The sight bluntly spells out the reality of their situation.<br>The ones before them are far from the only clones.<br>They, too, were once among them. They were mass-produced humans.<br>Everything was arranged this way.<br>They are nothing but pawns used to fight against the Flowers.<br>What, then, are their memories?<br>What was the agony they experienced when their child was taken from them?<br>What is the inferno of revenge that burns within them?<br>The couple accesses the attached console in search of answers.<br>They've come too far to leave empty-handed.<br>They've crossed the point of no return.<br>The records reveal to them a terrible, unthinkable truth.<br>The truth is that they are but two of many mass-produced clone soldiers<br>implanted with false memories.<br>Genuine humans no longer exist on the planet. They died out long ago.<br>And...<br>Over the many years of battle, resources are nearly depleted,<br>leading the military to devise a plan to recoup these losses.<br>The plan: to break down and analyze<br>the Flowers and then use their parts as resources.<br>Initially, they were used mainly for fuel, food, and other daily necessities,<br>but the military gradually expanded the scope of their usage.<br>Before long, they began using Flower corpses<br>as the raw material for clone soldiers.<br>The Flowers propagated rapidly as they fed on the soldiers.<br>The soldiers were created from Flowers.<br>Though they were at eternal war,<br>both sides were quietly entangled in a symbiotic relationship.<br>All the couple can do is stand there in shock.<br>Shocked by the truth that their enemy—the ones they sought<br>vengeance toward, the despicable entities responsible<br>for taking everything from them—are the ones that give them life.<br>But the top brass never revealed this truth,<br>nor did they find a breakthrough in the war.<br>They simply pushed forward with an aimless battle.<br>Of course they did—the Flowers became an indispensable resource.<br>If they were eradicated, humanity would soon follow.<br>The Flowers are a function of life in this modern civilization.<br>They are the foundation that supports all life,<br>the pillar of the precious food chain.<br>Is the couple little more than the cogs that make up this hellish machine?<br>And what of the precious, devoted affection they hold<br>for one another that keeps them going in this world?<br>What of the tragic memories of losing their dear child,<br>the source of their immeasurable will and wrath in battle?<br>It is all a deceitful fabrication.<br>A tale of fate meant to guide the couple.<br>And above all else, if humanity died out long ago,<br>then this eternal war is a meaningless massacre.<br>Is this the only meaning our lives hold?<br>The husband is furious over the empty truths,<br>his spirit cracking to its breaking point.<br>Without even despair to keep him,<br>he crumples to sit on the floor and gazes into an invisible distance.<br>But the wife remains in her spot, staring at the data.<br>Haven't you seen enough?<br>Doubting there's much point in learning any more terrible truths,<br>the husband lifts his head and speaks.<br>No, I haven't.<br>She responds, her voice ringing clear with will.<br>The light has not yet gone from the woman's eyes.<br>It's the face of a person who has not yet given in to hopelessness.<br>How can you still be optimistic?<br>The husband asks with curiosity.<br>The wife, however, gives an undaunted smile.<br>I finally understand what I'm—no, what <i>we're</i> supposed to do.<br>She turns to her husband and extends a hand.<br>We'll put an end to all of this. It's something only we can do.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The Flowers destroyed the prisoner couple's base.<br>In the process of ridding the base of scattered seeds,<br>they ventured into the hidden core of the building.<br>There, they learned that the soldiers who fight the Flowers,<br>themselves included, are clones.<br>The soldiers were born from Flower corpses.<br>Genuine humans had long since died out.<br>All that remained was the bizarre symbiotic relationship between Flowers<br>and clones.<br>This truth was enough to render to ash any and all reasons to press on that<br>they had been clinging to.<br>Or so one would have thought.<br>The wife does not despair at all.<br>If anything, she is optimistic that they can end this cycle.<br>Look at this.<br>She brings her husband to his feet and points at a record on the terminal.<br>Fanned out over the screen are biological records of the Flowers,<br>as well as experiment logs.<br>There <i>is</i> a way to defeat the Flowers—it's just that nobody has put<br>it to practice yet.<br>Hidden among the collection of meticulously thorough experiment logs<br>is an article on a particular chemical.<br>This chemical rewrites a part of the genetic code that makes up the Flowers<br>and accelerates their growth until they wilt—a decisive weapon indeed.<br>Along with a wealth of data from the research are instructions on how to<br>synthesize this chemical.<br>Who came up with this?<br>As though answering that very question,<br>ID numbers of those who proposed the chemical are listed<br>at the end of the article...along with photos of their faces.<br>They look exactly like the couple.<br>Judging by the years written on the report,<br>they were clones several generations prior to themselves.<br>They desperately fought the Flowers, desperately studied their<br>characteristics...<br>And they ultimately completed research that could wipe out<br>the Flowers once and for all.<br>Was it the by-product of something?<br>Or was it something these clones created in secret for themselves?<br>The research logs offer no insight into these questions.<br>What is clear, however, is that this chemical could not be made public.<br>The Flowers could not be eliminated—they were a precious resource.<br>That is the conclusion the military leaders came to,<br>and all information regarding the chemical was hidden away here.<br>The Flowers pushed humanity to extinction.<br>And now,<br>there is a way to eliminate them once and for all dangling within reach.<br>This was the clones'—<i>their</i>—only wish.<br>Their research was taken from them and likely destroyed.<br>But their will to eradicate the Flowers flourished.<br>It remained with them.<br>And though it could be an inexplicable coincidence,<br>they find themselves here in this future.<br>Ironically, it's thanks to the top military brass that the data was hidden<br>away intact rather than wiped from existence entirely.<br><i>We must carry this tenacity forward.</i><br>The words echo in the woman's head after a brief moment of hesitation.<br>Their goal remains the same as ever—they were to eradicate the Flowers.<br>Only now, their reasons are different.<br>It's not for revenge but for something far greater.<br>Here, with the many precious things humanity left behind,<br>they will put an end to this warped symbiotic relationship between them<br>and the Flowers.<br>It is their only path forward.<br>You understand too, don't you?<br>The husband looks to his wife and nods firmly.<br>Yeah, I understand—they're your thoughts. <i>Our</i> thoughts.<br>They embrace, collect their courage,<br>and right themselves to walk forward.<br>In this moment, their hearts are one.<br>They reached their hapless fate,<br>and records of the past appeared before their eyes.<br>Their singular goal: to create the chemical and take back the planet from<br>the Flowers.<br>The couple's lives rest on this fight to break the eternal cycle<br>of life and death.<br>They were born, killed, and eaten, only for the process to repeat.<br>They never knew why they were born nor why they lived.<br>That, too, ends today.<br>The battle to prove their worth, to prove their humanity, starts here.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The prisoner couple fights against the Flowers, humanity's natural enemy.<br>They have learned the harrowing truth of this world.<br>The truth is that they are clones and that they and their fellow clones were<br>born from the Flowers.<br>Though they know their memories are false, they press on hand-in-hand.<br>It's finally done.<br>Their past selves—clones from several generations prior—developed<br>a chemical.<br>This chemical rewrote parts of the genetic data that made up the Flowers<br>and accelerated their growth, pushing them to wilting.<br>The two cut off all communication with the outside and focus solely<br>on producing the chemical,<br>using the research data that the military superiors kept hidden.<br>There is ample information in the records on the synthesis of the chemical,<br>but the process itself proved difficult.<br>Many of the steps are far outside of their fields of expertise,<br>but they can't risk attracting the military's attention<br>by seeking help from the outside.<br>They trust only each other, working together closely to create the chemical.<br>All that's left now is attaching payloads to the drones in the hangar.<br>Limited time, limited resources.<br>Though they lack great amounts of the chemical,<br>there's still a chance of success.<br>We only need one strain. Once the Flowers are exposed to the chemical...<br>With victory before their eyes, the couple smiles at each other.<br>Their memories are false. Their lives are fabrications.<br>Yet, in spite of being presented with the truth,<br>their bond remains as strong as ever.<br>They are comrades in arms through adversity.<br>They are family who navigate life together.<br>Their implanted memories were no more than the spark that ignited their love.<br>The footprints they left behind were undoubtedly real.<br>Tomorrow's the big day. So today, let's—<br>Before the wife can finish, an alarm blares throughout the base.<br>The ground rumbles, and vines slither through every gap in the room,<br>entwining everything they can find.<br>These were the seeds left behind by the Flowers.<br>They paused their seed disposal to prioritize synthesizing the chemical,<br>but they assumed they would have a few more days before they bloomed.<br>Perhaps it's an unlucky coincidence. Or perhaps the seeds sensed something.<br>Perhaps they instinctively sensed their impending doom.<br>They would silence the couple here before they can disperse the chemical.<br>Honey!<br>On it!<br>The two go straight to battle.<br>With all their might, they mow down the budding Flowers,<br>trampling them as they rush to the hangar.<br>Though it's not far away, through the chaos and distress, it feels like miles.<br>Despite it all, the couple reaches the hangar, their breath ragged.<br>They manage to activate a number of drones,<br>affix what little of the chemical they have, and set them off.<br>The amount of chemical they managed to synthesize will likely only kill<br>a portion of a given area's Flowers.<br>But to the couple, that's more than enough.<br>Besides killing Flowers outright, the chemical has another effect.<br>Pollen from Flowers exposed to the chemical would have a similar effect.<br>Pollen spreads far and wide and with great speed.<br>It would carry on the wind across the land, across the seas,<br>across the entire world.<br>The multiplicative nature of the effect means even the tiniest amount<br>of chemical could purge the planet of Flowers forever.<br>The effects are already taking effect on the budding Flowers in the base.<br>The seedlings are born, immediately wither, then die.<br>The couple heaves a victorious sigh of relief.<br>But their victory is not without its sacrifices.<br>As she watches the Flowers wither,<br>the wife is suddenly overcome by a terrible coughing fit.<br>A stream of blood pours from her mouth.<br>The husband then clutches his chest in pain.<br>The chemical that would eradicate the Flowers is both a panacea and poison.<br>It affects those created from Flowers—the clones called prisoners.<br>This detail was not mentioned in the lab report.<br>At a certain point, the clones' genetic data began to closely mirror<br>the same base sequence as that of the Flowers.<br>They were born from the same material, after all.<br>As the couple produced the chemical, they realized this.<br>They knew they would die if their strategy succeeded.<br>This was the greatest reason the military hid and sealed away<br>all information regarding the chemical.<br>Once they dispersed the chemical,<br>it wasn't only the resources of the Flowers they'd lose.<br>They would lose their lives as well.<br>Yet, despite knowing this, they pressed on with their research.<br>They gave everything to bring this agonizing eternal cycle to an end.<br>The drones take to the sky and scatter the chemical.<br>The compound glitters in the sunlight.<br>As death approaches, they sit,<br>neither having the strength to stay on their feet.<br>They lean against each other, waiting for time to pass.<br>The husband is pleased with the success of their operation and satisfied<br>with a life well-lived. He smiles through a cough.<br>It's all over after this. Our suffering...and this world.<br>He speaks with resignation. But his wife does not nod.<br>Blood spills from her lips, but she gathers enough strength to reply.<br>No—everything <i>starts</i> here.<br>The husband nods in understanding.<br>In a world where everything spins toward destruction,<br>this act is little more than a blip of chaos.<br>Flowers wilt and die, and the clones aren't far behind.<br>A long, harsh winter is surely on the horizon.<br>But the planet has been reclaimed.<br>The eternal war will come to an end,<br>and those who survived will lead new lives.<br>Essentially, true freedom has been reclaimed.<br>In place of the Flowers that brought humanity to extinction,<br>new life will bloom across this world.<br>How far into the future that might be, the couple can't say,<br>but the future is awash in the light of hope all the same.<br>They hold hands and gaze up through the open roof of the hangar.<br><br><br><br>The sky outside the base is dyed a dirty ash.<br><br>But in their minds, it's a crisp, clear blue.</p>
