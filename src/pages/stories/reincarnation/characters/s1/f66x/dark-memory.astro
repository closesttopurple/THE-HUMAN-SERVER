<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">"This is a tale of the recent past."<br>"A tale of a time when she was still human."<br>"A tale of how Flowers were born into the world..."<br><br>"You're going to grow up big and strong." A woman murmurs these words to the organic<br>matter growing inside the incubator. She operates the console with a practiced hand. Holographic<br>panels float in the air before her, displaying detailed information on the status of the matter in the<br>incubator. The data is diverse, covering everything from humidity and temperature to the<br>concentration of oxygen, elemental makeup of the soil, and even thermal conductivity. Each number<br>is one piece of a delicate dance; if one fails, the others will follow. It is difficult work, but the woman<br>feels pride at her success thus far. Once, thousands of years in the past, Earth contained what was<br>known as "nature." Uncountable plants and animals flourished in ecosystems across the mountains<br>and oceans—and they did so alongside humans. But due to human expansion and ecological <br>pollution—as well as disasters and climate change wrought by nature itself—the ecology was<br>weakened, and life began to sputter out. Now, the nature that once sparked plants and animals<br>across the entire planet has been entirely lost.<br><br>The woman works in a genetic research facility. It was built with the newest and best<br>technology available, and serves as a gathering place and laboratory for the world's most prominent<br>scholars and researchers. The woman, a leader in the field of genetic engineering, now concentrates<br>all her efforts on the process of regenerating extinct plants and animals.<br><br>"You seem extra happy today," she says to her latest experiment.<br>"So why don't we give this a go?"<br><br>She flips switches and presses buttons on the console. Moments later, there is a beep and liquid<br>sprays into the incubator. That liquid is a custom-made growth accelerant that interacts directly<br>with DNA. The moment it lands on the organic matter, a white flower springs out of the soil.<br><br>"Yes!" cries the woman.<br>She permits herself a single fist pump. In truth, she wants to leap up and go dancing through the lab,<br>but the fact she is under constant surveillance takes much of the fun out of such spontaneous<br>celebrations. Not to mention her embarrassing incident of long ago...<br>"Brought another one back, did you?"<br><br>The speaker is a large, muscular man in a lab coat. Though his physique is more appropriate<br>for a soldier, he is actually a talented scientist in his own right.<br><br>"Honey!" says the woman.<br>"I thought you were sleeping. But yes, come here and take a look at this."<br><br>She and the man have been married for five years. They met in this very facility.<br><br>"It's pretty," murmurs the man as he bends down to get a better look at the incubator.<br>"What's it called?"<br>"I don't know. But according to the literature, they say finding one will grant your greatest wish."<br><br>Though the woman would be embarrassed to admit as much, this story is the reason she chose to<br>bring the flower back. For she has a wish she desires above all else: A wish to see the world filled<br>with green once more. As she stares at the flower growing in the rich soil, she whispers her wish,<br>hoping that it might hear. This world knows nothing but heartache and loss, and she wants to give<br>it something good. It's the reason she studied genetic engineering in the first place. And though it<br>has been a journey of fits and starts, her plans are finally bearing fruit.<br><br>Suddenly, her thoughts are interrupted by the strident howl of an alarm, followed by a red<br>light in the incubator. The two look inside and see the flower rapidly shriveling.<br><br>"No," says the woman.<br>"No! Why is this happening!?"<br><br>She frantically rechecks the information on the panels. The numbers that represent the flower's<br>nutrients are all swiftly decreasing.<br><br>"Hang on. I'm going to raise the values."<br>She pumps additional nutrients into the incubator—twice the normal amount. Liquid gushes out,<br>adjusting the concentration of oxygen and the nutrients within the soil. But the flower continues<br>to fade, its petals falling noiselessly onto the dirt below. Her husband looks at some of the numbers<br>and furrows his brow.<br><br>"Strange. This flower is using far more energy than normal."<br>It's a calm observation, one made from the experience of seeing countless flora wither away in his<br>own experiments. But the woman is in no mood to hear it.<br><br><i>I can't let it die</i>, she thinks.<br><i>Not now. If it dies, my wish dies with it.</i><br><br>She doubles down and focuses on the console. More liquid enters the incubator's glowing red interior.<br><br>"Come on," she says through clenched teeth.<br>"Come <i>on</i>."<br>"I'm not giving up on you now!"<br><br>Finally, the dripping flower begins to grow again,<br>its fallen petals regenerating before their eyes.... But it does not stop. A moment later, the Flower<br>smashes out of the incubator, sending tendrils and roots coiling across the floor. It almost seems<br>to be searching for something. And it shows no signs of stopping.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">A siren begins to wail. The couple presses against a far wall, trying to escape the thing<br>they have unleashed. The Flower continues to grow. Soon, the roots have covered the entire floor.<br>The walls are gone. The celling is gone. Nearly the entire room is buried in plant matter. Suddenly,<br>several of their fellow researchers force the door open and run into the lab.<br><br>"You guys all right?" one of them asks, breathless.<br>"We're fine," says the husband.<br>"Just used a heavy hand with the growth accelerant, is all."<br><br>The husband explains the situation because his wife is sitting on the floor, too stunned to speak.<br>Their fellow scientists express relief to know the couple is safe.<br><br>"I'm sorry," whispers the woman.<br>"God, I'm so sorry."<br>Her husband helps her to her feet and embraces her.<br><br>"It's all right. I'm just glad you weren't hurt."<br>His warmth melts away the tension in her heart.<br><br>"Hey, did you guys see this? It's really interesting..." One of their coworkers is tapping the<br>side of the Flower's stem. Others soon gather around to make their own observations, intrigued by<br>the situation. The stem is far tougher than that of the original plant. And its mass has clearly increased.<br>But it didn't do so through multiplying cells—rather, it has simply increased in size.<br><br>"Hang on. What's this?"<br>One scientist is staring at the petals.<br><br>"Guys, look. I think there's something in here."<br>"Wait, it could be dangerous," says the woman.<br>"No, it's okay. I'm just going to..."<br>"W-wait... My arm! It's got my arm!"<br><br>The man's voice begins to grow panicked. He's clearly not joking. Suddenly, he lets out a<br>horrifying wail. The other researchers attempt to pry the petals open, but they are hard as stone<br>and won't so much as budge.<br><br>"Help me!" screams the man.<br>"Oh god, SOMEONE HELP ME!"<br><br>The Flower begins to pull the man inside. His coworkers desperately try to free him, but they might<br>as well be pulling a mountain.<br><br>"H-help... Heeelp meeeeee..."<br><br>The man is gone. From inside the now swollen corolla comes the sounds of something straining<br>and cracking. Then it flies open and sprays blood across the entire room. A hunk of flesh—the<br>remains of their coworker—flies out and tumbles across the floor. As they watch, horrified, a new<br>Flower springs up from the meat. The germinated Flower grows just as rapidly as its kin, causing<br>the meat to shrink at the same time.<br><br>"My god..." says the woman.<br>"It's absorbing the nutrients."<br><br>With the meat depleted, the Flower begins to squirm and writhe across the floor in search of a<br>new source of food.<br><br>"Run!" someone yells.<br>"Get the hell out of here!"<br>The researchers dash away as one.<br><br>The screams continue. The Flowers pursue the survivors, slithering over the floor like<br>snakes with petals for heads. Each time one of the petals consumes a victim, a new Flower sprouts<br>from the remains. Their numbers grow. And grow. And <i>grow</i>.<br><br>"Here! Hide in here!"<br>The husband pulls the woman into a small closet in the corner of the research division.<br><br>They force their ragged breaths to slow as they try to remain quiet. Outside, the sounds of<br>slithering and screams are everywhere.<br><br>"What have I done?"<br><i>This was my experiment. My flower. And now it's eating people.</i> <i>Was it a dangerous plant that<br>should never have been revived?</i> <i>Was it the fault of the growth accelerant I formulated?</i><br>Before she can wonder more, her husband pulls her close.<br><br>"Right now, we just need to survive."<br><br>His embrace drives the fear and doubt from her mind. Her shivering slowly comes to a stop.<br>But the sounds outside continue without pause, and they know they do not have long. Suddenly,<br>her husband lets her go and reaches for the door.<br>"Hang on, honey. I'll be right back."<br><br>Before she can say anything, he bolts from the closet, seals the door behind him, and runs down<br>the hall while making as much noise as he possibly can. It's clear he's trying to lure them away.<br><i>No, please... Please don't leave me here alone...</i></p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Time passes—she has no idea how much. Eventually, the slithers and screams die off,<br>leaving the facility enrobed in an unnatural silence. She attempts to leave the closet, but the door<br>is locked. The woman feels her body growing cold, perhaps due to fear and guilt. All she can do is<br>wait and pray for her husband to return. Ironically, they had met in this very closet.<br><br>Her arms had been piled with equipment that day, and she was unable to work the knob.<br>Suddenly, her gallant knight swooped in and opened the door for her.<br><br>"Maybe leave a few things behind next time, ya dope," he'd said with a chuckle. Oh, she had been<br>mad. More than mad—<i>furious</i>. But as he continued to assist her from time to time, she found herself<br>becoming attracted to him. She had a tendency to get lost in her research, sometimes even forgetting<br>to sleep and eat, but he was always there to support her.<br><br>Suddenly, a faint voice snaps her back to reality.<br>"...There? Is anyone there?" The woman leaps to her feet and starts pounding on the door.<br>"Here!" she cries. "I'm in here!" Footsteps pound into place outside the closet. She hears radio<br>calls, breathing, muttered commands.<br><br>"We're going to cut through the door. Stand back."<br>A glowing red dot appears in the center of the door, sending up smoke. Soon, the high-temperature <br>cutter begins slicing a hole in the steel. When it is halfway done, she peeks through the opening<br>and beholds a horrible sight. The walls, floors, and ceiling of the facility have had furrows gouged<br>into them by the snaking movements of the Flowers. And within each furrow is tightly packed meat<br>that oozes fresh blood. Bodies that weren't absorbed had been ground into paste by the sheer bulk<br>of the Flowers. The woman can't even tell who they used to be. But when the smell hits her,<br>she turns aside and vomits.<br><br>"You all right, ma'am?"<br>The voice comes from a soldier looking at her through the hole in the door. He's covered head-to-toe<br>in thick black armor and holds an imposing beam rifle in his hand. He looks to be ready for war.<br>The woman nods, wipes her mouth with a shaking hand, and crawls out through the hole.<br><br>The smell is worse out here. <i>Much</i> worse. And it brings everything rushing back: The<br>screams of pain. The snapping of bones. The delight of the Flowers as they ate. She can hear and<br>see it all over again. She turns to the side and vomits once more, but all that comes out is a stream<br>of yellow bile. Her body has nothing left to give.<br><br>"W-were there any others survivors?" asks the woman, hoping against hope for a miracle. The<br>soldiers just shake their heads. The hues of despair grow darker. But she cannot stay here. Not<br>when he might be alive. Not when he might need her help.<br><br>"I'm coming with you," she says. "I need to find my husband."<br>"Oh, and I know every inch of this facility, so I can guide you wherever you need to go."<br><br>After a brief conference, the solders bring her along. Eventually, they arrive at the most<br>heavily damaged area. This is Research Block 21—the location of the woman's lab. It's as if<br>someone redecorated the room to look like a version of Hell. Everything, from the floors to the ceiling,<br>is painted red: Blood from the birth of a Flower. How many of her coworkers had been consumed?<br>How many had she <i>killed</i>? The guilt chills her to the bone. Suddenly, a deep bellow rumbles out.<br>Something is coming their way. Something massive.<br><br>"In positions, now!"<br>The soldiers raise rifles to shoulders as the enemy approaches. It's a Flower—one far bigger than<br>any they've seen before. It is the most horrible sight imaginable. The petals are imprinted with the<br>faces of victims. Not one face or two—but <i>dozens</i>. But the military captain pays this no mind.<br><br>"All units...fire." The world dissolves into a hail of gunfire. The Flower begins to scream.<br><i>My god... It sounds human. </i><i>Could it really have evolved human traits so quickly?</i> Above the crackle<br>and roar of the firefight, the woman hears a most familiar voice. And when she looks at the Flower<br>again, she sees the face of her love.<br><br>"Stop! Don't shoot him!"<br><br>She rushes for a nearby soldier, but he pays her no mind. Her pleas go unheard. Her actions are<br>meaningless. Her husband is gone. Knowing this, she breaks down into sobs.<br><i>This is my fault. It's all my fault.</i><br><br><i>I'm sorry.</i><br><i>I'm sorry.</i><br><i>I'm sorry.</i><br><br>When the fighting stops, the Flower lies unmoving on the ground. The woman cradles her dead<br>husband and continues to apologize. She does so until her voice finally fails her.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">Months go by. They thought they'd dispatched the Flowers that day.... But they were wrong.<br>Another Flower had been found. Then another. And another. The Flowers sow seeds soon after<br>they are born. It is all anyone can talk about anymore. The news is nothing but death figures and<br>horrible stories. And those who manage to escape often find they have no home to return to. The<br>Flowers evolve. They adapt. They increase their reproductive rates, perfect their strategy, and soon<br>are the greatest disaster the world has ever known.<br><br>"...No. No! NO!"<br><br>Enraged, the woman smashes her hand against the console. Her cheeks are hollow; her eyes<br>darkened pits. She can't remember the last time she slept. Currently, she is working in a small<br>laboratory constructed by another organization. Their only goal is to find a way to stop the Flowers.<br>As the sole survivor from the research facility, leadership of this fight had fallen on her shoulders.<br>She was locked away and tasked with analyzing Flower carcasses in order to find a chemical<br>solution that could kill them. For a time, it looked like their quest would be successful—<br>but the Flowers quickly evolved a resistance to the solution. Each time they created a new chemical,<br>the Flowers adapted to counter it.<br><br>Now, she stands before a Flower in a massive incubator. On its petals she sees the faces<br>of her coworkers and husband. Her mind has whirled with thoughts since that day. Were they<br>things she should not wish for? Did they go against nature? Was all of this technology too powerful<br>for humans? She has thought about putting herself out of her misery. But when she thinks of<br>what her husband went through, she finds herself driven by the need for redemption. But this, too,<br>is coming to an end. It has been five days since her liaison with the outside world stopped arriving.<br>Perhaps he decided the research was fruitless and walked away. Perhaps a Flower killed him. Her<br>food supplies are gone, yet she feel strangely at ease. She wonders idly if her senses are beginning<br>to break down. From a distance, she hears the approaching footsteps of the reaper.<br><br>"Honey..."<br>Her husband floats in the incubator, fully merged with the Flower. If she was just doing this to<br>die a failure in the end, it would have been better to become part of the petals with him. <br><i>But I know you wouldn't give up.</i> She stands up once more, fighting off the despair in her heart.<br>And then...an idea. She fiddles with the console, a faint smile on her face. Perhaps it is folly—<br>or perhaps it is the only way they will ever be able to kill the Flowers.<br><br>Days pass. The liaison never arrives. The woman is skin and bones, barely able to move.<br>She stands before the incubator with an inscrutable expression and stares at the thing inside. There,<br>floating in the tank, is a couple. She had combined the genes of people and Flowers to create<br>clones of herself and her husband. With a shaking hand, she operates the console. The liquid in<br>the incubator drains away, and the couple awakens.<br><br>"Your name is F66x."<br>"Your name is 063y."<br>"Together, you will eliminate the Flowers from this world."<br><br>The couple nods silently. No matter how many times they might be stricken with despair... No<br>matter how many times they meet a cruel end... They will be reborn again, and throw themselves<br>into battle with the hated Flowers anew. That is how they will achieve victory—and how the<br>woman will gain her redemption. And so, she gives her cloned self its first order: "Kill me."<br>The clone nods silently and wraps its hands around her neck. As fingers tighten, consciousness<br>slips away. Yet the woman wears an expression of utter peace.<br><br>Decades pass. The Flowers can infinitely reproduce. The clones can infinitely reproduce.<br>Their war rages on to this day. And in the midst of this neverending battle, nature begins to take<br>root within the empty cities.</p>
