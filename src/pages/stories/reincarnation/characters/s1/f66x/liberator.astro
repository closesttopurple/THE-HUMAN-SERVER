<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">The woman awakens in a ruin. Her last memory is of being stabbed before shoving
her husband off a cliff. Wondering why she is still alive, she wanders the ruin.
<br>She finds bodies littering the area, but knows not why they are there.</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly she hears the clatter of approaching footsteps, which causes panic to
well up inside her. But instead of a monster, the sounds belong to the allies
she has fought alongside, as well as her missing husband. The two of them
embrace fiercely, the moment made all the more joyful by the thought they would
never see each other again.</p>
<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The woman is brought to a hideout for former prisoners who have been deemed
defective and disposed of. After escaping death in one way or another, the
survivors hunkered down and began plotting to free their other fellow prisoners.</p>
<p class="para">Though the woman enjoys this short moment of respite, when she tries to
remember what happened after the incident at the cliff, pain shoots through
her head. She cannot recall why she is here, or even why she is alive.
<br>As she and her husband talk, they hear that an army is closing in on their
secret base—an army comprised of people who were once their fellow
prisoners—and the couple knows their only choices are to fight or die.</p>
<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Days later, when a quad of the former prisoners sneaks into the main base,
the couple hide among them. Their plan is to enter HQ as an advance scout team,
win over their fellow prisoners, and free them once and for all.</p>
<p class="para">Inside the base, the couple search for escape routes. They realize this is the
first time they have moved freely about the facility, and wonder why they had
been so obedient back then. But as they search, the commander arrives
once again to answer their questions. He tells them how humanity died out
long ago, and how the prisoners are all clones implanted with false memories
that motivate them to fight against the Flowers. He then informs the woman that
she must face her final test, causing pain to shoot through her head once more.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">They never had a child. They never spent peaceful days together.
<br>They were being used in experiments with no clear purpose in a world that
no longer even had a government. And as she realizes all this, the woman
also remembers what happened after she was stabbed.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Kill the enemy.</i>
<br>That is what she had been told—no, how she had been <i>programmed</i>.
<br>The enemy is now her husband, and her final test is to see if even her false self
can be turned into an obedient weapon of carnage. But as her consciousness
fades, she musters all of her strength and resists until the very end.</p>
<p class="para">Soon, an announcement rings out signaling the end of the experiment.</p>
<p class="para">The woman never moves again.</p>
