<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">I must go there...<br>My sister's voice is ever present in the depths of my mind.<br>Her voice is always there, no matter how hard the rain falls,<br>no matter how much the waves crash or the wind howls.<br>I must go there...<br>A small shed stands in a small garden.<br>A precious place where my elder sister once passed her time.<br>This is the place she remembered.<br>And so I go. That is her wish.<br>She cursed the world in her despair and departed this life.<br>I make this journey so that her wish may come true.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>Nightfall.<br>A motorcycle shines with a bright blue light. Like a shooting star,<br>it soars across a road suspended over a desolate canyon.<br>Its rider is a girl with white hair. Her slender frame deftly<br>steers the heavy vehicle as she tears across the landscape.<br>Dust from the headwind batters her eyes, yet she does not blink.<br>This speaks to her non-human nature.<br>Humanity on this planet is extinct. All that roams the land is<br>wildlife and puppets that take the form of humans.<br>Her gaze suddenly falls to her hands on the handlebars.<br>Her emotionless eyes become clouded.<br>She is uneasy.<br>Are these hands truly under her control?<br>Ever since she awoke at the research facility several months prior,<br>her body has sometimes acted of its own volition, as if someone else was piloting her.<br>At first, it only happened during her slumber, like an onset of sleepwalking.<br>But gradually, even while awake, this phenomenon began encroaching on her consciousness.<br>She briefly returned to the facility to research her<br>anomalies but ultimately found no effective remedies.<br>Her yield was not entirely fruitless, however.<br>It was there in the underground hangar where she found the motorcycle,<br>allowing her significantly faster travel.<br>And yet, something dreadful awakened.<br>...!<br>A gunshot rings out. A bullet shatters the ground beside the front wheel of her motorcycle.<br>She immediately accelerates. The bike's front wheel lifts upward,<br>putting distance between her and where she believes the foe is hiding.<br>Her right hand lets go of the handle, and she draws the spear from her<br>back just in time for several figures to leap from her blind spot.<br>The assailants wear white battle uniforms, and<br>all bear the same face with mechanical expressions.<br>They are defense androids, released to protect the<br>secrets of the facility where the girl was created.<br>When she returned to the facility to look into her anomaly, the androids suddenly activated.<br>Their main purpose: to prevent research subjects from escaping the facility.<br>All research subjects outside of the facility were disposed of without question.<br>The straightforward programming of the androids was analogous to vengefulness.<br>They would pursue the girl to the ends of the earth and annihilate her.<br>But no matter the obstacles she encountered, she would never falter.<br>The girl and her sisters were created as living weapons.<br>The first unit of their kind killed her sisters after losing control.<br>She was their subject zero. Their original.<br>The girl herself brought her down, yet the elder sister longed for the place in her memories.<br>She is almost there. And she cannot stop until her journey is complete.<br>The androids run as swiftly as bullets, quickly closing in on the motorcycle.<br>Her eyes dart left and right as she brandishes her spear in a one-handed feint.<br>She monitors the situation. There are more than ten enemies, but escape is not an option.<br>The elevated highway stretches into the horizon. Below her is a dark ravine.<br>There are no escape routes.<br>She has no choice but to fight.<br>The furious roar of the engine reverberates all around her.<br>The wheels make sparks fly as they skid against the pavement. The scenery becomes a blur.<br>The androids keep pace, brandishing their large machetes.<br>She forcefully cants the bike to the side, stabbing back with her spear as though in a dance.<br>That's when her greatest fear becomes realized.<br>As though no longer her own, her body stops listening to her commands.<br>Inky darkness slowly blots her consciousness.<br>It's a phenomenon she knows far too well.<br>Unable to control her body, she clings to the handlebars with what little focus she has left.<br>The androids exploit this opportunity.<br>They blow out the front tire with a long-range shot, causing the bike to spin out of control.<br>She will surely fall into the depths unless she intervenes, but she is powerless to steer.<br>The bike plows through the highway railing. She lets go of the handlebars and sails over the edge.<br>Girl and motorcycle both disappear into the bottom of the ravine.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>The fall feels like an eternity. The girl's consciousness falters.<br>Darkness surrounds her, and she can no longer discern dream from reality.</p>

<p class="para"><i>If only this were like the dreams I always have.</i><br><i>Then I'd use my wings and fly.</i><br><i>I'd never fall to the bottom of a ravine.</i><br>But we <i>can</i> fly.<br>A gentle voice tickles her ear. It is a familiar<br>voice—one omnipresent in the back of her mind.<br>It is the voice she has been chasing the entire time.<br>Sister?<br>With voiceless words, she calls out. But she receives no answer.<br>Hee hee...<br>A soft laugh, but tinged with darkness.<br>In a trembling, fragile tone, it says to the girl,<br>You know... You should destroy this world.<br>An impulse wells from within her—the sweet<br>temptation of rampage and destruction.<br>She feels her veins, her flesh, her bones melting away...<br>It's not unlike the process of a pupa she<br>once witnessed transforming within a cocoon.<br>And so, the girl...<br>She feels her arms become wings.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>A low rumble thrums through the air.<br>A gale whirls up from the depths of the ravine as though piercing the very heavens.<br>A white aberration appears from the swirling dust.<br>Wings spread from its arms, and it bears a tail akin to that of a white snake.<br>It is at once a thing of menace and awe, its towering body more than 60 feet tall.<br>In the face of the aberration whose brilliant glow<br>rivals that of the stars above, the androids falter.<br>Bewilderment colors their mechanical eyes.<br>The life signature of the aberration in the air perfectly matches that of the girl's.<br>Though no longer resembling her slender form,<br>this alien figure is undoubtedly the girl.<br>It glares down at the androids with red eyes.<br>Briefly withdrawing into the night sky, it soars directly toward its enemies.<br>The androids ready their weapons, but having been<br>caught off-guard, they can do little to stop the behemoth's ferocity.<br>The snaps and clatters of androids being ripped to shreds echo through the night air.<br>All that remains on the asphalt are<br>pools of red and inorganic corpses.<br>The aberration howls. The earth trembles in response.<br><i>Destroy this world</i>.<br>The pale aberration acts on its inner voice,<br>shrieking and running wild, destroying all in its path.<br>The girl's will is no more.<br>The dark of night.<br>The girl's orange eyes snap open.<br>She clutches her white spear in her right hand,<br>standing still on the suspended road.<br>The mercilessly shredded corpses of the androids surround her.<br>She is dumbstruck. She has no idea what occurred.<br>She had lost consciousness at some point.<br>She sifts through her memories to make sense of the situation.<br>She was riding her motorcycle on her journey to the place<br>her sister remembered. Her sister, a living weapon just like her.<br>But she was assailed by at least a dozen defense<br>androids from the research facility where she herself awoke.<br>She drew her spear to fight back, but suddenly lost control of her body.<br>This phenomenon was familiar to her—it was as<br>though some other force was taking over.<br>The androids exploited the situation,<br>sending her plummeting to the bottom of the canyon.<br>Her memory of the event ends there.<br>And yet, here she stands <i>above</i> the canyon, unscathed.<br>Her body sometimes moves of its own accord when she sleeps,<br>of this she is fully aware.<br>But could she truly have clawed her way back up without so much as a scratch?<br>To say nothing of the android corpses scattered to and fro.<br>Could she have stood a chance against that many attackers?<br>What happened, exactly? She tilts her head and gives a little hum.<br>She cannot remember.<br>Nor does she remember the sweet,<br>enticing voice she heard when she lost consciousness.<br>Nor transforming into a pale, winged aberration.<br>Nor laying waste to everything before her.<br>She approaches the broken railing along the road.<br>She peers into the ravine below, where she and her bike should have fallen.<br>It is black as pitch, a darkness so profound<br>that no ordinary eyes could ever hope to see what lies beneath.<br>But her eyes are far from ordinary.<br>She can see the twisted remains of her motorcycle.<br>She senses something behind her.<br>She swiftly spins her spear, whirling around to protect herself.<br>There stands one of the androids.<br>A defense android in white battle armor.<br>Its head drooped, it regards the bodies of its<br>companions, which litter the road like detritus.<br>Its expressionless face is impossible to read.<br>It stares at the mechanical corpses in an eerie,<br>prolonged silence.<br>At last, it slowly lifts its head.<br>Its artificial eyes lock with the girl's.<br>Her eyes glow a bright red.<br>At once, the two leap forward, engaging in melee combat.<br>A living weapon versus an android.<br>One wields a great spear, the other a menacing machete.<br>The clang of metal on metal resounds at an inhuman volume.<br>The girl's spear lunges out with frightening precision.<br>She has full control of the back-and-forth...or so it seems.<br>After some time, her body grows heavy, and she begins losing control.<br>Perhaps she is still recovering from the effects of her sleepwalking.<br>For the briefest moment, she leaves herself open. The android rushes in,<br>the tip of its blade gouging her shoulder.<br>The android's flurry of attacks is relentless.<br>The girl attempts to evade the android's reach,<br>but the damage she sustains slowly saps her consciousness.<br>She senses her impending doom.<br><i>But I have come so far...</i><br><i>I am so close...<br>So close to the place from my sister's memories.</i><br><i>I cannot fall here.</i><br>She <i>must</i> fulfill her sister's wish.<br>Her sister's spirit cannot rest until she does.<br>However—<br>No matter her tenacity and will,<br>her consciousness sinks into darkness.<br>Sister...<br>Her last words as all goes black.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">In a research facility far, far away, a living<br>weapon in the form of a girl was born.<br>As the weapons were mass-produced,<br>more and more of these sisters came into the world.<br>The sisters spent their days fighting<br>monsters and lived out their lives within the facility.<br>Until one day.<br>Subject zero.<br>The very first sister, the original, lost control of herself and destroyed the facility.<br>The interior was reduced to ruins.<br>Some time passed, and a lone girl awoke in the facility.<br>Where was she? Who was she? She did not know.<br>But a voice reached out to her.<br>I want to go back to that place.<br>It was the voice of the original. Her older sister.<br>And so the girl left on a journey for this place in her<br>sister's memories, to fulfill her sister's wish.<br>The girl finds herself in a world of deep blue.<br>Her hair sways. Her body floats. It's like the empty<br>ocean floor—the world she could see from the windows of her birthplace.<br><i>Where am I?</i> she wonders.<br>She remembers doing battle with a pursuing android on the<br>way to her destination and losing consciousness.<br>But you are still yourself.<br>A familiar voice.<br>Suddenly, a girl with black hair stands before her.<br>Though her hair and skin are different, she greatly resembles the girl herself.<br>Indeed, this is the original of the living weapons.<br>The older sister herself.<br>Sister?<br>When she lost control, she became an alabaster abomination.<br>It was the girl herself who brought her down.<br>But here she stands in human form.<br>We are inside your mind. I am a memory that lives on within you, she explains.<br>An impish smile crosses her face.<br>I have an idea—why don't you give me your body?<br>The girl understands exactly what she means.<br>Ever since awakening in the facility,<br>she was sometimes beset by the sensation of something taking over her body.<br>It was induced by what little memory of the original remained within her.<br>She had considered the possibility of her sister's memory<br>taking control of her, but decided to turn a blind eye to the truth.<br>Now, however... She can no longer look away.<br>What would you have me do?<br>She asks her older sister.<br>I want you to destroy the place in my memories.<br>She pauses to process the implications of her sister's words.<br>It was the sister who so often cried out in the back of her mind to return there.<br>It must be desTROyed.<br>That place, the WORld—all of it. We must destROY it all.<br>Her sister's voice changes in tone. She moves closer.<br>YOu are my vessel. Give me yOUr BODy. WOULd ouu, please?<br>As though swimming through this azure world, she approaches the girl.<br>The moment they join hands, the girl's vision wavers.<br>A torrent of the sister's emotions course through her,<br>drowning out the girl's consciousness.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>I always thought I wanted to go back.<br>To the warm garden. To the little shed where I sat. The place in my memories.<br>And yet, I thought it strange.<br>I am a weapon created in a facility. Why do I have these memories?<br>One day, the android who created me approached me<br>with a weary expression, as though confessing his sins.<br>I am, in fact, human.<br>I was discovered in cryostasis and then modified into a weapon to fight monsters.<br>The moment I learned the truth, my memories flooded back to me.<br>Memories of my life as a human.<br>Memories of my friends. My family. The warmth that surrounded me.<br>I couldn't breathe.<br>My mind went blank.<br>I didn't know what to do.<br>The place in my memories that I so longed for—my family,<br>the beautiful garden, the little shed—was no more. I had nowhere to return to.<br>And then I became this white, winged abomination.<br>I completely lost control.<br>I slaughtered my sisters with my own hands.<br>My dear, beloved sisters.<br>Nothing precious would ever return to me.<br>A world bereft of light.<br>What worth is there in a cold world that took everything from me?<br>I have no choice but to destroy it all.<br>Things of no worth have no reason to exist.<br>I will first return to the place I loved when I was human.<br>It will be the first place I go. And from there,<br>my path of destruction will begin.<br>All so I may bid this world farewell.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>The world is painted a deep blue. It sways to and<br>fro like the depths of the ocean. This is the girl's heart.<br>Her sister's memories are filled with intense pain.<br>Bearing witness to her memories, despair<br>washes over her from head to toe.<br>It is agony. She feels as though she is drowning.<br>Her breath catches in her throat, and she presses a hand to her chest.<br>Standing before her is her smiling sister,her<br>black hair gently swaying in this azure world.<br>She waits for the girl to surrender her body.<br>She waits to obtain the power to destroy the place in her memories.<br>Everything the girl did was for her sister.<br>She sought this place her sister remembered, after all.<br>She crossed the seas and came to this continent for that sole reason.<br>Should she, then, turn over her body and let her sister destroy the place in her memories?<br>Perhaps so.<br>And yet...<br>I could never let you destroy that place, Sister.<br>Disappointment colors her sister's face.<br>The girl can sense the pain in her sister's heart.<br>And yet...she cannot silence the will that has bloomed within her.<br>You have always, <i>always</i> wanted to return there. You mustn't say such things.<br>What dO YOu kNOW about me?<br>In her agitation, she grabs at the girl. But the girl calmly shakes her head.<br>She understands the depths of her sister's unbearable despair.<br>But destroying the place in her memories will do little to heal her wounds.<br>Your memories have always said that you wish to return there.<br>The place you love more than anywhere else.<br>If it were destroyed, she would only hurt herself deeper.<br>The girl looks up to the sky of this azure world.<br>A light shimmers far above.<br>That must be the exit. If she can grasp the light, she can wake up.<br>She knows this instinctively.<br>Shaking off her sister's hand, she reaches up to the light.<br>Wait! Don't go!<br>Her sister wails as she is left behind. The girl fights off the urge to return and embrace her.<br>She must go to the place from her sister's memories.<br>There...she will return her sister. A place where she can do no harm.<br>Where she will sleep eternally.<br>Only then will the girl see her sister once more in the azure world.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>The girl's orange eyes snap open.<br>The tip of the android's blade flies toward her neck.<br>She bends backward to dodge the slash and leaps off the ground,<br>putting distance between them.<br>She flexes her fist once, twice, thrice. Autonomy over her body has returned to her at last.<br>But she is reaching her physical limit.<br>And yet...<br>Dauntlessly, she lifts the head of her spear and takes a readied stance.<br>No matter how many wounds she sustains, she must reach that place.<br>It is her dying vow.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">Her legs may give out at any moment, yet the girl steps firmly,<br>one foot at a time, onto the grassy plain.<br>She fought with defense androids sent to eliminate<br>her to preserve the research facility's secrets.<br>Amidst the melee, she came into contact with the memory and<br>will of subject zero—her older sister, who slumbered within her.<br>She found herself on the brink of being consumed by her sister's<br>deep hatred and despair, but she rallied herself and overcame her opponent.<br>Her body approaches its limit, but she cannot stop here.<br>She must reach the place her in her sister's memories—a small<br>shack overlooking a pleasant garden. How desperately her sister wished to return there.<br>She vows to make that place eternal.<br>And so, no matter the cost, she must go there.<br>The deep blue of the grassy plain at night stretches toward the horizon.<br>As she walks through the grass, she realizes that she—her<br>sister's memories within her—recognizes this place.<br>She is close to the place her sister so desperately wished to see once more.<br>With ragged breath, she carries her heavy legs forward.<br>And with each step, tears spill from her eyes.<br>She does not understand the emotions that flow through her.<br>She presses onward with nostalgia, warmth, and melancholy in her heart.<br>Tears stream down her cheeks, but she does not wipe them away.<br>Her sister's parents built this shed for her.<br>Weather and time have taken their tolls and all that remains is a bare husk.<br>The warm garden that should be filled with flowers is covered<br>over with tall grass. It hardly resembles her sister's memory.<br>And yet...there is no doubt that this is the place.<br>The girl at last arrived at her destination.<br>But she comes to a stop, unable to approach the ruins of the shed.<br>She reaches to take her spear from her back.<br>Her pursuers: defense androids.<br>She had thought she had destroyed them all along the way,<br>but it seems some remained after all.<br>She focuses her senses and seeks her enemies' locations.<br>Five in total surround her, hiding in the tall grass.<br>For a body that can scarcely walk, it is a dire situation.<br>But a faint smile crosses her face as she rallies herself once more.<br>Her eyes glow red.<br>She refuses to cede a single step. She has vowed to protect<br>the place from her sister's memories. To make it eternal.<br>The androids lunge at her from all sides. The battle begins.<br>With her spear, she fends off the knives<br>that come at her from every angle.<br>The harsh clangs of metal on metal.<br>That she can fight in this state is nothing short of miraculous.<br>She fends the androids off as she seeks an opportunity to turn the situation in her favor.<br>But at the same time, she feels herself losing control.<br>It is not due to the injuries she has sustained but rather the dormant<br>memories of her sister that threaten to come to the forefront.<br>At last, she falls to her knees.<br>She no longer has the strength to wield her spear.<br>The androids' silhouettes rush toward her.<br>She closes her eyes, bracing for the end.<br>A thought flashes in her mind.<br>Do I fear death?<br>Once the androids kill her, they will likely return her <br>corpse to the facility, along with the memories of her sister within her.<br>No more sisters will be born. She will simply lie in a ruined facility.<br>And the place from her sister's memories will wait<br>unguarded for an owner who will never return and fall to ruin beneath the night sky.<br>It is a fate worse than any death.<br>The girl can picture it behind closed eyes.<br>She sees the crystals that glowed faintly like<br>jewels within the ruined facility—the corpses of her sisters.<br>Living weapons like herself turn to crystal upon death.<br>It is a function meant to prevent the decay of memories so that<br>they may be passed on to the next generation.<br>But in their eyes was an eternal gleam that<br>would never fade and could never be taken.<br>And now—<br>As the tall grass stirs in the dark of night, the girl's body glows.<br>Her crystallization—her death—has begun.<br>But she does not intend to let things end here.<br>For this death marks the beginning of her eternity.<br>White light beams from her crystallizing body.<br>It draws a gentle arc in the air, melting all it touches,<br>swallowing it, and turning it to crystal.<br>Her android assailants turn to crystal, as does<br>the grass, the trees, and all the little flowers.<br>White light envelops all, and all turns to crystal that will forever sparkle.<br>It shines a cold blue beneath the dark sky.<br>A torrent of white light rushes across the endless<br>expanse of the plains and, finally, the place<br>from her sister's memories.<br>The warm little garden, the shed's remains—it all becomes a part of the girl.<br>White crystal swallows everything whole. One day,<br>it would become a great cocoon, standing proudly beneath the stars.<br>White crystal—the corpse of a living weapon.<br>An eternal gleam that will never fade or cloud.<br>The place her sister so adored.<br>The place the girl so longed for.<br>Immortalized within crystal brought on by her death.<br>No one will ever destroy this place now.<br>It is eternal.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>My sister cries within me.<br>She cries alone.<br>She cries in despair over losing a place she can never return to.<br>Over killing her sisters in a rampage.<br>The pain she bore became a hatred so<br>profound it transformed into a desire to destroy all she held dear.<br>But now...I understand. She was simply sad.<br>So sad that all she can do is cry.<br>So sad she wants to destroy it all. So deeply, unfathomably sad.<br>Sister... You've endured this all alone.<br>I pull her close into an embrace.<br>I pull her close into an embrace.<br>She bawls like a child, and I hold her tightly,<br>stroking her soft, black hair so she will never be alone again.<br>Ever since I awoke in the facility, my sole<br>purpose was fulfilling my sister's wish.<br>Not once had I considered what I wanted,<br>or how I'd want to live once the journey ended.<br>But I understand now.<br>I will protect your memories here. I will be the place to which you return home.<br>She continues to cry. She presses her soaked<br>cheek to mine, and in a vanishing voice, she says,<br>Thank you...for protecting the place from my memories.<br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>The girl falls into a deep slumber.<br>A slumber from which she will never awaken.<br>And she returns the life she was given with a warm smile on her face.</p>
