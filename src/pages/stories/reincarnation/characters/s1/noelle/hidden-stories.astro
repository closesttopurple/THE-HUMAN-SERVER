<p class="title">Chapter 1: Escape (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">I hear a song, but I do not know what it is<br>about, for I cannot understand the words.<br><br>As the sound of a language unknown to me<br>echoes in my ears, I cannot help but feel as<br>though this song is one I've heard before.<br><br>Seeking out the voice I walk on through the<br>mist, eventually finding a small hut nested<br>among some trees. This hut, too, feels<br>familiar to me somehow. Yes, I remember<br>now... I used to play here often.<br><br><cspace=-0.16em>----------<br><br>Feeling as though someone has called out<br>to me, I turn around only to see that I am alone.<br>All I see before me are my long bangs drooping<br>lazily in front of my eyes.<br><br><cspace=-0.16em>-----<br><br>...The hair is black, which is not the color<br>of my own hair.<br><br>"...Who am I?"<br><br><cspace=-0.16em>-----<br><br>I awake with a start, feeling a sharp pain<br>tear through my throat as I gasp.<br><br>Steadying my breath, I pinch the hair<br>sticking to my sweat-slicked brow.<br><br>"...It's okay. We're okay. My hair<br>is white, just like it should be."<br><br>Making sure that nothing is out of the<br>ordinary with myself I attempt to rise<br>to my feet, but quickly find that while<br>nothing may be out of the ordinary with<br>myself, the place I am in is most<br>unusual indeed.<br><br>I fell asleep in a room within an abandoned<br>building. Unable to fight the need for sleep<br>any longer, I had lined up some chairs so<br>I might lie down on them. And yet, I awake<br>now to find the sun shining directly overhead.<br><br>"...Again?"<br><br>I am a living weapon created in a research<br>facility. Created as the youngest of all among<br>all my sisters, I left the facility that birthed me<br>and embarked on a journey of the world<br>on the surface. My destination is a place that<br>the original—the eldest among us sisters, and<br>the one we are all copies of—loved and wished<br>to return to while she was alive. Having inherited<br>her memories, I vowed to go there in her stead.<br><br>Unfortunately, it seems the place in question<br>likes across the sea, somewhere far beyond<br>the horizon. Left with no other path forward,<br>I spend my days going from ruin to ruin,<br>searching for a way to cross the great sea.<br>I could not say how many fruitless days<br>have gone by.<br><br>During that time, I have begun to notice<br>events of an unusual nature. For example,<br>I might lean my spear against a wall before<br>going to sleep only to find it in a different<br>position when I wake up. Or I might find<br>notice entries in my journal that I do not<br>recall writing myself. It was all small things<br>so I initially thought nothing of it, but now<br>I even have days where I awake in a totally<br>different place from where I went to sleep.<br>There are sometimes even times where<br>I awake to the scent of blood.<br><br>Perhaps these could best be described<br>as "symptoms" of a sort. I do not know<br>if it is appropriate to apply such a word to<br>a weapon like myself, but it seems to resemble<br>what humans referred to as "sleepwalking."<br><br>Indeed, as I sleep, my body is engaging in<br>activities of its own volition in places I am<br>unaware of. Worried that whatever it is that<br>controls me as I sleep might also one day seize<br>control in the waking world as well, I fear my own<br>body might no longer be my own. Should such<br>a thing come to pass, I would no longer be able<br>to go to the place my sister wished to return to.<br><br>...I cannot have that. That is why I've decided<br>to return to the facility I came from—so I might<br>learn what is happening to me. Even if I were<br>to secure the required equipment and medicine,<br>I do not know if treatments intended for humans<br>would work on a weapon such as myself.<br><br>Also, during my journey on the surface, I've read<br>a great many things. I've engaged with the knowledge<br>left behind by humanity. I've read books in libraries,<br>discarded scraps of papers, and journals of unknown<br>origin. <br><br><cspace=-0.16em>-----<br><br>No matter where I search, however, never once<br>have I found records regarding myself or my sisters.<br>If I am to look into matters concerning my own body,<br>I've no choice but to turn back to the facility I came<br>from—the only place where any information about<br>us exists.<br><br><cspace=-0.16em>----------<br><br>But I've come so far... All I can think about is how<br>I've walked for so, so long in search of this place<br>inside my sister's memories. Turning back and<br>returning to the facility will only put more distance<br>between me and my ultimate destination.<br>How long will it take before I am finally able to<br>discover a means of crossing the sea and reach<br>the place I wish to be?<br><br>I find the prospect terribly difficult to stomach,<br>but I begin my march all the same, for I know in<br>my heart of hearts that it is necessary if I am<br>to day one step foot on that land of memories.</cspace=-0.16em></cspace=-0.16em></cspace=-0.16em></cspace=-0.16em></cspace=-0.16em></p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Nostophobia (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">"A power outage?"<br><br>I sit in the elevator under the sea—which has ground<br>to a halt in mid-ascent—and murmur to myself. <br><br>One specific place was imbedded in my elder sister's memory,<br>and after much thought, I decided to leave the research<br>facility and go there. But along the way, I was afflicted<br>with a mysterious illness akin to sleepwalking, and began<br>to feel like my body no longer belonged to me. <br><br>Once this happened, I turned around and began retracing my<br>steps along the road. I wanted to find the place where I<br>was born—the place I once called home. Because if I did,<br>I hoped I might find some clue that explained my symptoms. <br><br>But then the elevator that connects the facility to<br>the surface malfunctioned and...<br><br>Well. Here I sit.<br><br>When I place my hands on the doors and yank them open,<br>I see the space where the elevator travels up and down—<br>a space called a "shaft," if I remember the term correctly.<br>I poke my head through the gap and stare down into the dark.<br>The window that looks into the water is open; faint rays<br>of sunlight filter through the ocean depths, bathing the<br>shaft in a faint blue. <br><br>It's my way out. <br><br>When I leap from the elevator, I put my hand on the glass<br>and slide down its face. There is no time to fear, no time<br>to hesitate. I <i>must</i> figure out what is plaguing me.<br><br>I land at bottom of the shaft, brush the dirt from my<br>clothes, and stand. I'm at the entrance to the facility.<br><br>The door appears stuck, so I pry it free and step inside.<br>The corridor is shrouded in darkness and silence,<br>making the echo of my footsteps sound like a thunderclap. <br><br>"Let's see about getting the lights on," I say aloud, <br>hoping to drown out the sound of my thunder. <br><br>I find my objective in short order. The generator is badly degraded, which explains the power outage—and also the<br>breakdown of the elevator. I press buttons on a nearby<br>switchboard, routing what little energy remains to the<br>room in which I hope to find the necessary documents.<br>The lights flicker and warble, but it seems like they'll<br>stay on long enough for me to conduct my search.<br><br>They do. But it doesn't matter.<br><br>I can't find what I'm looking for. Things would be easier<br>if I could use a computer, but I have no such information<br>in my memory; I wouldn't have even been able to operate the<br>switchboard without the instructions etched on its front. <br>So instead, I find myself leafing through stacks of paper<br>documents. Some are in bundles several pages thick,<br>while others have been shredded into long strips.<br>Regardless, I collect them all.<br><br>Still, this is a facility that runs on machinery, and it's<br>likely the documents I'm searching for were never printed<br>out. So what happens then? What happens if I <i>can't</i><br>find what I'm looking for?<br><br>As that thought crosses my mind, I distract myself by trying<br>to piece together various shreds of paper. This proves a<br>fruitful endeavor, and I quickly find a censored sentence<br>unlike any I've seen: <br><br><i>...■■■■■■■■ function, and the regulation and memory<br>management that comes with sleep, we have successfully<br>regained partial control over No. 6 after ■■■■...</i><br><br>Some words have been redacted for security reasons.<br>This <i>has</i> to mean something. It <i>has</i> to be valuable. <br><br><i>While the cause of the ■■■■ remains unclear,<br>this incident suggests that prolonged activity<br>is linked to the onset of symptoms.</i><br><br><i>Despite their nature as mass-produced articles,<br>an accumulation of memories creates personality<br>differences. Other anomalies did not come with this<br>risk of creating defined personalities.</i> <br><br>I have no idea what the missing words could be, but a loss<br>of control sounds very much like what I'm experiencing.<br><br>I race through the document, praying to find some other<br>piece of information, and discover this at the very end:<br><br><i>At present, the best way to manage this is to delete<br>a unit's most enduring, impactful memories.</i><br><br>Something that causes loss of control once symptoms manifest?<br>I can't be certain this is the same thing as the sleepwalking<br>I'm experiencing, but I do know I get neither "regulation"<br>nor "memory management" from sleep. I'm drowsy. I fall asleep<br>quickly and without warning. It's a clear personality quirk<br>I have in comparison with my elder sisters.<br><br>But if prolonged activity heightens the risk of accumulating<br>impactful memories, then I am in a terribly unsafe position.<br>Perhaps, at this point, my memory would have been erased.<br>I mean, that would probably be the best course of action<br>if I want to ameliorate my symptoms.<br> <br>And yet... <br><br>All my sisters are dead—all except me. I am the final<br>repository for the memories of our original sister,<br>and I can't let them go.<br><br>Not when I promised to reach the place from her memory<br>in her stead. <br><br>I hear a sound, then: a click. Metal on metal coming from<br>somewhere behind me. Without thinking, I stick my spear in<br>the ground and use it to propel myself up and onto the wall.<br>When I look down, I see something sticking out of the place<br>where I was standing not a moment before.<br><br>A blade. <br><br>It does not breath. I feel no heat. There is no life there.<br><br>Yet two figures stand in the darkness all the same.<br><br>Two figures that, like me, are made to look human.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Heretical Number (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">I am afflicted with an anomaly akin to sleepwalking.<br>Postponing my journey, I returned to the facility where<br>I was born in search of a cure.<br><br>There I found documents detailing the dangers posed to us<br>weapons brought on by personality differences. The cure to<br>the anomaly, I read, was to delete my memories.<br><br>It was then that I was ambushed.<br><br>Though I dodge, my joints scream at the sudden movement.<br>I glare at my assailants through fluttering papers.<br><br>Inorganic footsteps approach. Dull, heavy clacks echo around <br>me. The two figures in the darkness hold their weapons at<br>the ready.<br><br>They wield large swords. Repelling weapons of that size and<br>weight would be nigh impossible. Cornered against a wall<br>with only a spear, allowing them to approach is tantamount<br>to defeat.<br><br>But knowing so little about my opponents, I hesitate to take <br>the offensive.<br><br>Why do they attack me? I do not know their goal, origin,<br>or even what they are.<br><br>When I first left this facility, I sensed no life besides my <br>own. Did they come from the outside? Or perhaps they laid<br>in  wait this entire time? The shadows are devoid of breath<br>or warmth, only standing there, staring.<br><br>The swaying tips of their blades lift like cobras displaying <br>hostility.<br><br>Deciding my course of action, I kick off the wall. Although<br>their nature is unknown to me, their human form is evident.<br>I will first take out their legs—their center of gravity,<br>their proof of evolution.<br><br>Harnessing centrifugal force, I strike the closer android<br>with my spear. She flies backward.<br><br>But she dodged me. I expected as much. Tiles and<br>construction materials fly from the floor. I step onto<br>the dust and detritus and circle behind the enemy.<br><br>I shout and spin my body clockwise, lending my spear to the<br>movement. I will not leave myself open. I aim for the legs<br>again, my spear swiping at the floor the moment her foot<br>comes down.<br><br>I feel it in my hands—I hit my mark. The severed leg slides<br>across the floor, rust-red blood streaking across the white<br>tiles. Something isn't right.<br><br>My eyes follow the line to the cross-section of the<br>disembodied leg. Inside are pipes and a metal shaft.<br><br>These are machines. But I have no time to process this<br>revelation—a blade slices through the air behind me.<br><br>Holding my spear behind me with a pained grunt, I somehow<br>manage to block the attack. My arm stings, my bones creak.<br>I must put distance between us. But a new sound rings in my<br>ears, cutting off my thoughts.<br><br>"Weapon escape detected. Activating defense androids."<br><br>An alarm blares throughout the laboratory, followed by the<br>sound of a heavy door opening and the shudder of machines<br>dropping to the floor. My instincts as a weapon warn me of<br>the danger.<br><br>These machines must be defense androids. And this must<br>mean reinforcements are en route.<br><br>Parrying the sword weighing on my spear, I kick the enemy's<br>head. I must get out of here. But just as I begin to run,<br>a shadow descends on me.<br><br>An android drops toward me, sword at the ready, at a<br>velocity unthinkable for one missing a leg. I attempt<br>to divert her trajectory with my spear. However...<br><br>A loud metallic sound resounds around me. The force behind<br>the sword is unimaginable, spending my spear flying.<br><br>I sense impending doom and hear the opponent I kicked behind<br>me. What am I to do? If I die here, I will never reach—<br><br>Desperation and instinct force me to whirl around...<br>and I doubt my own eyes.<br><br>The dismembered remains of a machine.<br><br>"What...?"<br><br>Her parts lay scattered, liquid slowly pooling on the floor.<br>In her reflection, a ray of red light.<br><br>That light comes from my eye. And now I realize I hold in my<br>left hand a sword—the one that once belonged to my eldest<br>sister.<br><br>I feared losing control of my body while I slept, but now<br>it moved all on its own, even in my waking hours.<br><br>Is my body no longer mine?<br><br>"My" right hand effortlessly swats away the descending<br>blade, and "I" adopt an offensive stance.<br><br>With my right hand, I grab the enemy by the arm and hurl her<br>against the wall. She collides violently, her machine body<br>contorting unnaturally. My other hand throws the sword,<br>pinning her there. <br><br>A weight akin to being saddled with heavy baggage comes down <br>on my shoulders.<br><br>Have my symptoms calmed yet? I hold my tense right hand<br>in front of my eyes. No red light illuminates it. I stare at my<br>palm, closing and opening my fist.<br><br>I'm fine now. I can move it freely.<br><br>The android pinned to the wall struggles to remove the blade<br>piercing her chest. The corridor behind her is filled with<br>shadows—a whole group of them.<br><br>That's my sister's sword. I planned on bringing it to the<br>place from her memories.<br><br>I solemnly reach for my spear on the floor.<br><br>"Forgive me." <br><br>I grasp it, turn my back to the enemy, and run.<br><br>I stand no chance against that many foes. If I die here,<br>all will be for naught. And so I rush ahead with but one<br>destination in mind. I have no other option.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Sign (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Countless metallic footsteps reverberate as the horde<br>of machines chase me through the labyrinthine facility<br>corridors.<br><br>These machines are defense androids, deployed to prevent<br>the escape of research subjects. They seem to have been<br>reactivated when I restored a part of the facility's power—<br>they were nowhere to be found when I first awoke here.<br><br>Shaking the thoughts, I flee from the androids' pursuit.<br>My destination: the room I saw when I operated the<br>switchboard. There I will find a way to escape this<br>predicament. I know it.<br><br>As the door opens, I leap inside. The hallway panel reads<br>"HANGAR"—this is it. I topple over two nearby shelves to<br>block the door, though I know it will only buy me a few<br>seconds.<br><br>I begin my search with bated breath, tearing away protective <br>cloth and prying open a metal casing to inspect the contents.<br><br>This isn't it. Nor that. It's not here.<br> <br>I repeat the process until I come to a large case melded<br>into the wall, but I'm quickly interrupted by the shrill<br>sound of the shelves being cut through.<br><br>A finger stripped of its metallic skin juts through the gap.<br>I'm out of time. I destroy the lock with my spear and step<br>into the casing.<br><br>I find a large machine inside. Brushing off a layer of<br>dust, I can make out an imprint: Si'N-02. Here it is.<br>The motorcycle from the memories I inherited—a<br>machine developed to assist us weapons in battle.<br><br>I leap into the seat, but much like the facility itself,<br>it has sat here dormant and long forgotten.<br>There's no guarantee it will function.<br><br>The door and shelves go flying. The horde of machines glare<br>at me menacingly from the hideous hole in the wall. I press,<br>squeeze, and stomp everything I can in an attempt to start<br>the engine. "Come on, please work!"<br><br>Suddenly, its lights come on, and an electronic voice<br>speaks. "Biometrics authenticated. Serial number 123<br>confirmed. Startup sequence initiated." Vibrations rumble<br>through the handles and seat.<br><br>I turn the throttle and the engine purrs.<br>"I can work with this," I whisper to myself as I propel<br>the bike forward. At the far end of the room is a passage<br>appended to the hangar.<br><br>It's a long, long chute. The androids still pursue me, but<br>evidently, some diverted this way—many stand at the ready<br>above me.<br><br>Spear in my left hand, I shoot up the slope, evading my<br>pursuers, breaking through blockades with the bike,<br>knocking away obstacles with my spear,<br>and pressing ever forward.<br><br>I reach the end of the corridor at last. A door stands<br>before me. I grip my spear tightly.<br><br>For a brief moment, I envision my sister's sword—a precious<br>thing I inherited from her. But I've long since crossed the<br>point of no return.<br><br>Metallic echoes ring out. The door opens a crack.<br>In floods dust and light.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, I accelerate full-throttle toward<br>the light.<br><br>Once more, I exit the facility and find myself at<br>the surface. I ride the bike over cracked roads.<br>Presumably, this passage was originally used to<br>bring vehicles such as mine to the surface.<br><br>The androids still tail me, but I doubt they can keep pace<br>with my bike's speed.<br><br>"Phew..."<br><br>I heave a sigh, resting my tired body on the vehicle and<br>losing myself in thought. I think back to when my eye<br>glowed red.<br><br>I held that sword in my hand, and its weight felt so<br>familiar. It belonged to my sister—perhaps her memories<br>are the cause of my anomalies.<br><br>On the other hand, I am a weapon. Surely I'm intimately<br>familiar with all manner of sword hilts.<br><br>However...if she—the original—is the one controlling<br>my body...<br><br>Should I surrender it to her?<br><br>My destination is the place in her memories. Better that she<br>find her own way there than have someone else do it in her<br>stead.<br><br>But what would happen to me?<br><br>I envision myself in impenetrable darkness.<br><br>There is no sound. I am alone.<br><br>All I have is my breath.<br><br>I can't answer my question, and I don't know why.<br>I can't even begin to explain the logic.<br><br>I learned so much on the surface. The names of so many<br>things. I grew to express so much with words.<br><br>And yet... No, perhaps it's for those very reasons that<br>I cannot describe this feeling.<br><br>My fingers along the handle tremble, perhaps owing to<br>the cold wind. I tighten my grip and twist the throttle.</p>

<p class="para">The scent of oil fills a crumbling building. Inside, a girl<br>repairs the motorcycle that will serve as her legs for the<br>upcoming journey.

There's also a faint, high-pitched sound<br>that suggests abnormal engine combustion.

Not a partner. Not a friend. But she<br>lightly pats the worn seat cushion anyway, and says<br>to the silent motorcycle:<br><br>"Just a little further now, buddy. You can do it."</p>

But she<br>was clearly unhappy with the holographic data we provided,<br>because she recently submitted a request for a tour of the<br>cultivation room. <br><br>We went back and forth over whether to grant permission,<br>and eventually settled on giving it a trial run in order to<br>diminish her stress levels.
