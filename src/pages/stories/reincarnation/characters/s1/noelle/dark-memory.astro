<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">Machines line a darkened room like a row of steel coffins. With a sudden noise, a single<br>door swings open. The coffin contains a sleeping girl whose pure-white hair reaches down to<br>her shoulders. As her lashes flutter faintly, her eyelids slowly lift.<br><br>Dark orange eyes shine out. They dart back and forth in an attempt to grasp the situation.<br>The first thing she sees is a monitor affixed to the wall. Then a dozen or so unmoving female<br>figures. She blinks once and stares at their faces. She turns her gaze to each, one after the<br>other. After a moment, she realizes they are all identical.<br>Eyes. Hair. Lips. Ears. Skin. Clothing. Height. Weight. Every detail is perfectly matched.<br><br>"......"<br>The girl shows no surprise at this. But it's not as if she knew it was coming. In truth, she knows<br>nothing at all. Her expression is simply blank. As blank as her shimmering white hair.<br><br>She exits the machine and takes a few steps forward. She passes the other girls and<br>comes to the center of the room, then looks around again. There are around a dozen girls,<br>and an equal number of empty machines. It seems she is the last to awaken. The monitor is<br>blank. Besides the floor and walls and ceiling, there is nothing else to the room. Having taken<br>in the room, she now looks down at herself. Her clothes are the same as her companions. Her<br>collar—which is high enough to hide her mouth—contains a small apparatus on the inside.<br><br>The girl turns to look at the monitor. Her face appears on it, a reflection from what scant<br>light exists within the room. The face in the reflection matches the other girls. A pair of<br>emotionless eyes stare back at her. After a time, the screen lights up blue. White shapes are<br>projected on the monitor. They blink and change shape, over and over again.<br><br>"......"<br>The girl understands nothing; she simply stares at the dancing figures on the screen.<br><br>Suddenly, the apparatus in her collar springs to life, accompanied by a high-pitched<br>sound. The moment it does, the girl's consciousness is flipped upside down. Voices ring in<br>her head. Scenery dashes across her vision. Information flows inside her like a raging river.<br>Her head feels hot. The hallucinations link together; images become words in her consciousness<br>as they burn into her mind.<br><br>V    O  IC E  CO L O   R  P  AI  N LI G  HT HE  A T FOR M S HA D OW<br>vOICE COLoR PAiN LIghT HEat ForM shaDoW <br>voice color pain light heat form shadow<br><br>*huff* *huff*<br>The girl's vision returns. Her breathing remains ragged, her footing unsteady. But now she<br>understands. <i>We are weapons.</i> She brushes aside her sweat-slicked bangs and directs her<br>attention to the monitor. It contains writing in stark white letters:<br>"ELEVENTH FORCED MEMORY CONFERMENT SUCCESSFUL."<br><br>Weapons built from plants or animals are known as "living weapons." In the case of these girls,<br>they are based on a single human. From the time they were born to the moment they woke up,<br>they were implanted with the instincts of a weapon and administered drugs that forcefully<br>caused them to mature. Once they are ready, they will be given the necessary knowledge to<br>function as a weapon and sent into battle. They will never know the meaning of killing—or of living.<br><br>Now, a new mission is ready for them. The order appears on the screen:<br>"EXTERMINATE THE THIRTEEN TARGETS."<br>Multiples of an identical voice echo through the room, all saying the same word: "Yes."<br>Following the description of the operation, target information appears on the screen. There is<br>no sound; merely words and charts that appear on the screen one after the other before<br>vanishing again.<br><br>"END BRIEFING. COMMENCE OPERATION."<br>With that, the monitor goes dark once more. With the blue light gone, the room is again plunged<br>into shadow. A white light pours in, tearing the gloom apart. A portion of the wall moves, granting<br>a view of the outside world. A black van appears in the light. The girls begin their operation,<br>piling into the vehicle with perfectly synchronized footsteps.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Approximately twenty-one minutes have passed since the beginning of the operation.<br>Within an area that was once the city center, the girls stand and stare at a single point. They<br>encountered the first target four minutes after arriving at their destination. But things have not<br>yet proceeded to a combat situation. There is one reason for that... The girls stare at their lone<br>target. Much like the girls, it is made with humanoid elements, including a head, torso, and<br>four limbs. But each part is warped and twisted, like a doll haphazardly stitched together. Its<br>skin reflects the sunlight, creating an eerie rainbow. All these facts are just as their intel said<br>it would be.<br><br>The girl at the rear of the group is the one who woke up last. She wields a sniper rife.<br><br>"......"<br>She peers down the sight, checking on her allies. The ones on the front line wield swords and<br>other close-combat weapons. Those with spears, greatswords, and other large weapons stand<br>behind them, while those with long-range weapons—like the girl herself—watch and wait from<br>even further in the rearguard. The weapons were procured from the self-driving vehicle they used<br>for transport. Each girl was allotted a different one that signified their role. Though they all share<br>the same faces and minds, they soon begin to separate from one another based on the weapon<br>they have been given. After checking on her allies, the girl sights the target.<br><br>Something is different from their pre-battle information: The target shows no reaction to<br>their presence. While it seems to know they are there, it shows no interest, instead choosing<br>to draw idly on the ground with a single finger. This behavior is strange; they had been told their<br>target exhibited characteristics of being "violent and cruel." This expected behavior was the<br>reason they had approached the upcoming battle with such caution.<br><br>Five minutes later, events finally begin to unfold. A sword-wielding girl approaches the<br>target. She walks with slow, measured steps. The sniper carefully observes the situation. When<br>the sword-wielder is fifteen meters away, there is movement. Empty eyes turn to stare at her.<br>They survey her calmly. The moment she raises her sword, the target leaps into the air.<br><br>The battle has begun. The target twists in the air and uses the speed of its fall to slam<br>its arms down on the sword wielder. She blocks the attack with the blunt edge of her weapon.<br>A cloud of dust rises in the air at the impact. In the midst of it, the girl's eyes glow red. Empty<br>eyes lock onto a crimson gaze. Both are shaped like humans, but both are false. A red light<br>zips around within the dust. Blows and parries are traded with inhuman speed. Attacks collide.<br>The red light stops. The dust slowly settles, exposing the pair. The sniper takes in a short breath<br>and holds it. She pulls the trigger.<br><br>The bullet pierces the air. The moment the sound reaches the target's ears, its left arm<br>is blown from its body. The shock robs the creature of its ferocity. It slowly collapses into a<br>defenseless heap. Another girl leaps forward from behind the sword user. Her spear pierces<br>their foe, ending it. <i>Target one, silenced.</i> The sniper thinks these words to herself. At the same<br>time, she notices a strange sensation. Almost like a hole is being filled. But the girl does not<br>understand what the feeling is, or what brought it about. As though confirming something,<br>she looks at her palms. There is nothing there. Even though she had just felt she had obtained<br>something.<br><br>"...Huh?"<br>She readjusts the grip on her rifle and stands. With the strange sensation still in her chest,<br>the girl and her companions set out for the next target. In front is the one who wields the<br>sword. The roles given to them in battle had led her to assume a natural position of leadership.<br>The girl in front looks down at her palm as they walk. She also does not know the source of<br>her discomfort. What they feel is not joy in victory; simply excitement that their perfectly<br>coordinated actions have led to success. But the girls do not yet understand that.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">A white shadow dashes across the ruins. The girl runs silently; ahead, her companions<br>are locked in battle with a mighty foe. If her hurried footsteps make even the slightest sound,<br>the operation will end in failure. Yet if she slows her pace in hesitation, there would be many<br>casualties.<i> What's the best plan of action?</i> The girl runs. She wipes her bloody hands on her<br>sleeve, adjusts her grip on her rifle, and increases her pace.<br><br>They encountered the mighty foe fifteen minutes ago. They had just eliminated the<br>eleventh target when it happened: Calamity itself rose up above the ruins of a building. It stood<br>nearly ten meters high. Its body was unnatural—an image of the human form, but forcefully<br>stretched and enlarged, with skin scarred like an old roadmap.<br><br>It was a mutant:<br>A being that had somehow gained characteristics<br>which typically did not exist in their kind. This information was shared with them before the<br>battle. But while they expected the mutant target, the did not expect it to appear with such <i>speed</i>.<br>The mutant fell from the sky like a meteorite, crushing one of the girls on contact. Before the<br>group could even register this fact, it had felled another of their number. The girls' blood rained<br>down across the ruined city. The mutant's empty eyes towered above them.<br><br>Which brings us to the present. While the group successfully reorganized their formation,<br>the battle has not yet turned in their favor. Dodging the mutant's constant blows, the girls<br>deliver their own. But their blades cannot pierce its thick skin. Their movements begin to slow,<br>exhaustion taking hold as attack after attack comes up empty.<br><br>But then, the sound of an explosion from behind the target: The unmistakable percussion<br>of a sniper rifle. A large bullet pierces the mutant's neck, causing the massive figure to stagger.<br>But it quickly recovers. The bullet's path becomes another scar. As the girl loads another bullet<br>in the chamber, the mutant makes a slow turn to face her.... Which is exactly what she wants.<br>The human body is covered with soft muscle and skin that stretches and contracts as it moves.<br>And the larger a body is, the more that muscle and skin is forced to move and contract—and to<br>stretch thin. The scars on the mutant's skin are places that have been damaged from this<br>constant stretching. It was the sword-wielder who first realized this. As the mutant turns, a scar<br>tears open on its lower back. And while its attention is focused elsewhere, the sword-wielder<br>leaps high in the air and slams her weapon through the opening. The mutant lets out a cry as it<br>crumbles to the ground. The girl continues running up its back, dragging her blade behind her<br>to create a massive canyon of flesh and bone. Blood fountains from the wound, painting her red.<br>The mutant falls face first onto the ground. The earth shakes. Dust flies. The moment it falls, the<br>remaining girls focus their attack on the head. Specifically the neck, where the bullet has created<br>a new scar. The sniper fires again, creating a new furrow in the creature. The rest of the group<br>attacks this new opening with relish. The mutant shivers. It howls. Its fingers contract, convulse...<br>and then, finally, it moves no more. Watching from a distance, the sniper releases her grip on her<br>rifle and lets out her breath. The purpose of holding her breath is to steady her aim. It is only<br>natural to exhale after the shot. But this time, it almost sounds like a sigh of relief. She shoulders<br>her rifle and prepares to rejoin the group.<br><br>But before she can move, a sound erupts behind her. It is the thirteenth target. It had<br>emerged from the ruins close to the isolated sniper, and now tears out her windpipe. Blood<br>mists across the air. Crimson spreads over the ground.<br><br>"......"<br>A ragged breath escapes from her ripped throat. In her dimming consciousness, the girl looks<br>at her palm. All she finds is her bloody, lifeless hand.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">And so, the thirteenth target falls. With the operation complete, the driverless vehicle<br>returns. The armored machine carries the group back to the place where they first woke up.<br>It is dark in the vehicle, and featureless save for slots to store weapons and handrails along<br>the sides. It is the typical construction for a vehicle that carries weapons.<br><br>The automobile motors across the wilderness. The girls sit on the floor inside. A full half<br>of them do not make the return trip. The air is filled with the scent of metal and oppressive<br>silence. The weapons on the wall still drip with blood. One of the girls stares at them for no<br>reason in particular. She sees her own sword, as well as a number of weapons that no longer<br>have anyone to wield them. Some of the slots contain nothing at all, their weapons having been<br>too damaged to recover. In particular, many guns are missing, and the largest such gap is one<br>that used to hold a sniper rifle. A thought crosses the girl's mind as she stares at the space:<br><i>There is a hole that will never be filled.</i> The journey continues. No one speaks. Despite<br>the silence, they still hear nothing from outside the vehicle. Finally, the girl stops staring at the<br>weapons and closes her eyes. She leans back and waits for time to pass. She knows the return<br>trip is the same distance as the first, but it seems to be taking much, much longer. It feels like<br>she will be in this vehicle forever.<br><br>Some time later... The vehicle finally comes to a stop. Its doors open automatically.<br>Light pours inside. The girls file out. Some walk slowly, nursing wounds. Some walk slowly,<br>nursing exhaustion. But the girl who had her eyes closed does not move; instead, she remains<br>in the vehicle and listens to the footsteps of her companions slowly fade into the distance.<br>Once that sound is no more, she opens her eyes, forces herself to her feet, and steps out.<br>The moment she touches ground, the sound of the large doors closing begins. On a whim,<br>she turns back to look. She sees the wall of weapons slowly disappear.<br><br>"......"<br>The engine begins to hum. The girl stands in place, completely alone, until the vehicle drives off.<br><br>When the girls return to their dark room, they see cold white letters on a blue screen.<br><br>"WELL DONE."<br>"THERE ARE FEWER CASUALTIES THAN ESTIMATED."<br><br>The words of praise flicker for a moment before vanishing. A rundown of their next operation<br>suddenly springs to life on the screen. Though the objective and plan remain the same, the<br>scale this time will be larger, including the number of targets. Which means their numbers will<br>need to be replenished. The girls stare silently at the screen. Once the mission statement is<br>complete, the screen urges them to enter the row of machines for rest and wound treatment.<br>Each girl replies with a single word: "Yes."<br>But unlike the last time, they do not speak in unison. The screen falls dark. The girls follow<br>orders and return to their coffins.<br><br>Inside, the girl who closed her eyes cannot stop her thoughts.<br><i>They estimated the number of dead and injured.</i> <i>Those deaths had been predicted from the<br>start.</i> <i>I am alive.</i> <i>But that only means I survived this day.</i> <i>If I die tomorrow, I will be replaced.<br>The fight will go on.</i> She feels a sense of unease. Her thoughts spin as she drops her gaze to<br>her palms. There is nothing there. Perhaps there had never been <i>anything</i> there. What was<br>she trying to think of? She does not know. The machine fills with liquid. Her consciousness<br>fades. She had felt something in her hand. But now she feels nothing. How can there be nothing?<br>Her question still unanswered, the girl slips into the dark.</p>
