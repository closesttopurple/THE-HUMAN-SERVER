<p class="title">Chapter 1: Warm Hands (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">I met a monster in a strange place called The Cage. <br><br>The monster ate all my bad dreams so I stopped having them. <br><br>But when the monster kept eating my dreams, he turned into<br>a girl that looked just like me, and I became a monster.<br>I was so surprised, I didn't know what to do—so I ran away. <br><br>But secretly, I was happy to be a monster.<br><br>I wanted to forget about my dead dad. I wanted to forget<br>about my mom who abandoned me. I wanted to forget about<br>the other kids who bullied me. I wanted to forget everything. <br><br>I'm not human anymore. I'm a monster. <br><br>And I am going to forget everything.<br><br><i>Everything.</i><br><br>                  ＊          ＊          ＊<br><br>It's snowing; soft, white, and beautiful. <br><br>The strange place is made of stone. Some parts are covered<br>in leaves, and some let the snow in. Like this one. <br><br>The snow crunches under my feet as I walk down a long<br>white path. <br><br>I don't know where to go. <br><br>I want to go home, but I didn't know where it is. <br><br>I guess I forgot where I'd come from.<br><br>I don't know anymore. I can't remember anything. <br><br>Eventually I stop thinking about it because it makes my<br>head hurt. I forget all that and begin to run. Snow sticks<br>to my cheeks—it's nice and cold, and helps to erase the<br>fuzzy feeling in my head. <br><br>After a while, I come to a stop and see a woman sitting by<br>a cold stone wall. I thought I was alone in this place,<br>so I'm happy to see someone else. <br><br>But she's shivering. Is she sick? <br><br>"Excuse me, ma'am," I ask. "Are you okay?"<br><br>She looks over at me and screams.<br> <br>"MONSTER!" <br><br>She starts to shiver more after that, and I feel bad for her.<br>I want her to feel better. I start trying to spin and dance,<br>because that always makes me happy and I think it will make<br>her happy, too. But I can't dance very well in all the<br>slippery snow, and after a second I fall down on my bum—<br>which causes the lady to laugh.<br><br>"Are you feeling better, ma'am?" <br><br>She gives a little nod, and we start talking. She tells me<br>she found herself lost in this stone place, and wants to<br>go home so she can see her "family" and her "daughter." <br>Then she asks me how to get out of here. When I tell her<br>I don't know, her face gets all sad again. <br><br>"It's okay," I say. "We'll find a way home together." <br><br>I take her hand. My hands are super big, so I hold hers <br>gently, trying not to crush it. She looks up at me like<br>she's going to cry, then squeezes my hand tight.<br><br>"Your hands..." she says in a whisper. "They're so cold." <br><br>I realize then how cold my hands are, and remember how I was<br>trying to endure the cold. But I'm okay now, because the<br>nice lady's hands are so very warm.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: What Shines (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">I'm a monster in a big building made of stone. <br>        <br>I want to go home, but I don't know where that is. I don't<br>even know where I came from. I don't remember anything.<br>So I walk and walk and walk all by myself until I meet a<br>nice lady. She says she also ended up in the stone building<br>and didn't know how. She says she had to find the way home<br>to her "family" and "daughter."<br><br>So I take her hand and start to walk with her. <br><br>We walk up a long spiral staircase and the snow just stops.<br>There are red leaves everywhere—it's like a red carpet just<br>for us! The lady smiles and says it's beautiful. Then we see<br>a flower sprouting in the leaves and she smiles more.<br><br>"What a strange place," the lady says. "That flower bloomed<br>out of nowhere. My daughter would be delighted to see it."<br><br>The nice lady tells me all about her daughter while we walk.<br>Her daughter likes flowers, and also loves the nice lady.<br>They're always together, and are each others' favorite<br>people in the whole world. They also fight sometimes,<br>but they always make up. They're a "family," so even if<br>something is painful, they overcome it together.<br><br>The lady seems happy to be talking about her daughter,<br>and that makes me happy. Then she asks if I have a family.<br><br>"I don't know," I say, tilting my head. And it's true—<br>I don't remember anything. But I knew it would be nice to<br>have a family and a daughter like the nice lady.<br><br>"Oh, that's right," says the lady. "You don't remember<br>anything. But I'm sure you have a family. All living things<br>have beautiful families around them." <br><br>I leap in the air and say "Yippee!" I still can't remember<br>anything, but I want to go home to my beautiful family. <br><br>Suddenly, <i>pop</i>! Another flower blooms from the red leaves.<br>But it isn't the only one! <i>Pop, pop, pop!</i> So many are<br>blooming. Each of the little blossoms gives off a shine.<br>I feel like I can make a huge light if I collect them all!<br><br>The lady gasps in delight and starts picking the flowers.<br>"I'm going to pick a bouquet for my daughter!" she says. <br><br><i>Pluck, pluck, pluck.</i> She plucks so many that I feel bad<br>for the flowers. But the lady says flowers bloom so they can<br>be plucked, and that no matter how many we pick, they'll<br>never scream in pain. That makes sense, 'cause flowers are<br>always quiet and never talk or anything. So I pick lots with<br>the nice lady as we walk. <br><br>Finally, we come to a tall black statue. The lady says it<br>looks like a scarecrow, which I don't understand. But I<br>want to touch it, so I reach out. And then...<br><br><i>POP!</i><br><br>Me and the nice lady turn into dark mist and get sucked up<br>into the scarecrow!</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Cries of Flowers (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">The big stone building is so very strange. Now inside,<br>I'm trying to help a lady find her way home so she can<br>see her "family" and her "daughter."<br><br>When the lady first started telling me about such things,<br>I felt my heart grow warmer. While I couldn't remember <br>anything about myself, I knew I also wanted a "family" and<br>a "daughter." But then we found what looked like a Dark<br>Scarecrow. Curious, I reached out to touch it, and we<br>ended up getting sucked inside!<br><br>Now me and the lady are in a small house—a place different<br>from the leaf-covered stone building we were in a moment ago.<br>It's a messy house; bricks are pulling out of walls, and the<br>fireplace is full of garbage. All the chairs and tables are<br>scattered across the floor, and the windows are broken.<br><br><i>Where are we?</i> I wonder. But then the lady's eyes<br>go wide and she exclaims, "I'm home!" <br><br>This is the lady's house! Oh, I'm so glad she managed to<br>find it! But then I notice she's frowning, and a second<br>later she starts running this way and that.<br><br>"Where is she!? Where is she!?" <br><br>She repeats these words over and over like a spell as she<br>runs around the room. She yanks garbage from the fireplace,<br>and even turns over furniture that was already overturned.<br>Suddenly, she spins on a heel and runs into another room. <br>Though this is all very confusing, I decide to follow her.<br><br>The next room is just as messy as the first, and I find the<br>lady stretched out on the floor, running her hand back and<br>forth beneath a filthy bed. After a bit, I hear the sound<br>of something heavy being dragged, followed by a harsh cry.<br>A moment later, the lady pulls out a sobbing little girl<br>with a face covered in bruises!<br><br>"So it's not enough that Daddy does it?" snarls the woman.<br>"You're going to run from me too?" She then smacks the<br>girl's cheek with her hand, causing her to wail in pain.<br><br>"Stop it!" I cry. "You're hurting her!"<br><br>"Family is overcoming pain together," replies the woman. <br><br>...Family? Oh, I see. This must be the "daughter" she was<br>talking about. Still, if her child is so precious, why<br>would the lady hit her? Considering the girl's face is<br>covered in bruises, I don't want to think about how long<br>this has been going on.<br><br>"Help me!" screams the girl as she reaches for my hand.<br>"She's going to kill me!" <br><br>I have to do something. I <i>have</i> to. But when I look at<br>the girl, my head hurts and I can't move. I recognize the<br>look in her eyes: they are full of despair because no one<br>will bother to help her.<br><br><i>Wait.<br><br>That's right.<br><br>...I remember.</i><br><br>I was human before I became a monster—and I had despaired<br>just like the girl. My daddy died. My mommy left and never<br>came back. No one would help me. No one cared. I have no<br>home to return to anymore. <br><br>I break into fearsome sobs and begin to run. I have to.<br>Because if I don't, I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.<br><br>I leave the messy room and run outside. I run and I run and<br>I run—going for so long I don't even remember what happened.<br>When I finally come back to myself, I'm in the big stone<br>building. There are dead flowers all over the stone floor;<br>the same ones that were so happy and bright moments before.<br><br>The petals look like bones. Ash.<br><br>They look like they're crying.<br><br>But I can't hear the flowers crying.<br><br>No one can hear the flowers crying.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Kindly Child (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">I always wanted a home to go to, but never knew where to<br>find it. I'd forgotten so much. I'd forgotten <i>everything</i>.<br><br>But now? I remember.<br><br>I was human before I became a monster, and I no longer<br>have a home to go back to.<br><br>Daddy is dead.<br><br>Mommy abandoned me so she could be with a strange man. <br><br>I'm alone. In despair. I'm in so much pain. My chest hurts.<br>I don't know what to do. I yell, but nothing happens. <br><br>I need help. I need to find someone who will help me, so<br>I run through the giant stone building looking for someone.<br>I run and run until my legs ache and my lungs burn. I feel<br>like I'm going to cry, but my monster body has no eyes,<br>so I can't.<br><br>I climb to a higher spot and look at the sky. Sand floats<br>on the wind, turning it a sickly yellow color. <br><br>And then... <br><br>"Is that...?" <br><br>I hear a voice from below. I look down and see a white,<br>floaty creature, as well as a girl dressed in black. Both of<br>them are looking up at me. The girl has beautiful eyes—like<br>a flower. She looks so very kind; I wish I could talk to her. <br><br><i>I'm sad.</i><br><br><i>I'm lonely.</i><br><br><i>I'm hurt.</i><br><br><i>Save me.</i><br><br>There are so many things I want to say to her, but I can't<br>say anything because my head is pounding. And the longer I<br>look at her, the more I feel like I'm going to remember<br>something else.<br><br>No. I don't <i>want</i> to remember anything else. I'm afraid<br>of finding despair again, like the moment I remembered about<br>Mommy and Daddy.<br><br>The girl doesn't say anything as she approaches. My head<br>hurts more. More. <i>More.</i> I feel like I'm going insane.<br><br><i>Don't come any closer!</i><br><br>"――――――――!"<br><br>Before I know what's happening, I fly at the girl, planning<br>to attack. But just as my hand is about to connect with her<br>head, our eyes meet.<br><br>I can't hurt her.<br><br>When that thought comes to me, I freeze. The girl opens<br>her mouth, but no voice comes out. Maybe she can't speak?<br><br>And yet, I feel like I hear warm words from her. <br><br>Why is that? I don't know. But as I think about it, my head<br>starts to hurt again. I can't stand it anymore, so I run away<br>from the girl. I climb the stone wall, aiming for a  high place.<br>The sand on the wind scrapes against my monster skin.<br><br>I feel so lonely. So isolated. I want to see her again—<br>to see her kind eyes. And yet, looking at her makes me feel<br>like I'm going to remember something, and that scares me. <br>So instead, I turn to the sandy yellow sky and scream.<br><br>I have nowhere to go, but I still want to find a home.<br><br>And the kindness I feel from the girl⁠ is exactly the kind<br>of home I want to return to.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 5: Angelic Sacrifice (No.05)</p>
<p class="para">Mama: If I were to describe<br>her in a word, it would be...<br>angelic! Yes, that's it.<br><br>Carrier: Seems you ain't been<br>acquainted with her more<br>devilish side yet. <br><br>Mama: Society can be so cruel.<br>How could they possibly<br>sacrifice a blameless child? <br><br>Carrier: Same cruel society<br>is always sacrificing my poor<br>salary too...<br><br>Mama: Still, I believe her<br>fate changed when she met<br>the monster. <br><br>Carrier: My fate changed when<br>I met my wife—in many<br>meanings of the word! Heyo!<br><br>Mama: Goodness, but you are<br>an irritating creature.<br><br>Carrier: Ow! Hey! don't pinch<br>me like THAAAT! OWWW!<br><br>Mama: The girl never lost her<br>kindness, even in the face of<br>needless malice. But though<br>that kindness was not enough<br>to bring her salvation, it<br>saved <i>him</i>, and he brought<br>salvation to her heart. In this<br>feedback loop of benevolence,<br>she became herself anew.<br><br>Carrier: GYAAAAAAH! HRAAAAAGH!<br>...HAH!<br><br>Mama: Oh my. You managed<br>to escape my grasp.<br><br>Carrier: Gimme a goddamn break<br>already, lady!<br><br>Mama: Language! That poor girl<br>would be sad to hear such<br>things from you, Carrier.<br>After all, she adores you.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 7: A Gift from Mommy and Daddy (No.07)</p>
<p class="para">One cold and snowy morning,<br>I looked out the window and<br>watched as my daughter had a<br>snowball fight with some of<br>the neighborhood kids. They<br>were all bigger than her—and<br>probably four or five years<br>older—but she kept making<br>snowballs and throwing them as<br>best as she could. That's when<br>I realized she was the only<br>one without gloves, and that<br>her poor hands were bright red.<br>Yet she still wore a beaming,<br>innocent smile on her face,<br>which made my heart hurt.<br><br>"Fio's so cheerful, even on a<br>frigid day like this."<br><br>My husband, having just woke,<br>came over to stand beside me,<br>watching our daughter amidst<br>the large crowd of children.<br>Once he left for work,<br>I looked for one of my old<br>sweaters. He'd given it to me<br>years ago and I'd always taken<br>good care of it, so I figured it<br>would still be in decent shape.<br>After pulling it out of the<br>closet, I unraveled it and<br>began to knit a pair of gloves<br>from the yarn, figuring the<br>soft hues would look better on<br>her than me, anyway. But when<br>my husband came home that<br>night, we looked at each<br>other and burst out laughing,<br>because he'd gone to town and<br>used what little money we had<br>to buy her a pair of mittens. <br><br>That night, I watched as our<br>little girl, worn out from<br>playing all day, snored softly<br>in her sleep. <i>May these<br>blissful days continue into<br>eternity</i>, I prayed as I<br>gently placed a small blanket<br>over her.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 8: Regarding the New Caste System (No.08)</p>
<p class="para">Next spring, a new social class will be established below<br>the Noble and Commoner classes. <br><br>These individuals will be called "Goat People," and will<br>be required to pay exorbitant taxes on the bulk of their<br>income.  Additionally, they will not be allowed to assume<br>any position of public service, and are expected to be<br>stripped of the ability to vote. In essence, these Goat<br>People will not only lose not only their economic freedoms,<br>but their basic human rights.<br><br>The council's jurists claim that introducing a lower caste<br>is expected to stabilize the government, but I say this<br>with everything in my heart: There can be no future for<br>such an inhumane system.<br><br>Today, the assembly hall was filled with those who oppose<br>the new system yet again. It doesn't matter if we end up<br>Goat People ourselves; no citizen rejoices in finding<br>fortune by means of grinding the less fortunate beneath<br>their bootheel. Even if the council steamrolls public<br>opposition and puts this outrageous class system in place,<br>we will never yield. All of us—Nobility, Commoners,<br>and Goats—must join hands and help one another.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 9: What the Monster Saw (No.09)</p>
<p class="para">Seeking freedom from their lowly status, a group of Goat<br>People gathered before the council building last night.<br>Guards were dispatched to control the situation, but a <br>riot broke out regardless.<br><br>Though the Goat People involved in the incident were purged,<br>residents continue to voice their unease. They are not<br>afraid of the powerless Goat People, but rather a horrible<br>"monster" that multiple eyewitnesses reported seeing at the<br>scene of the purge.<br><br>"It was that girl," one witness said as she trembled.<br>"The one they found dead in the ruins a few days ago.<br>She summoned that horrible thing. It was like something<br>straight out of a fairy tale..."<br><br>Separate rumors claim the Goat People were driven to riot<br>by their despair over the girl's death, which likely led<br>the eyewitness to make this connection. That said, the<br>council is currently looking into the "monster," and are<br>calling for all citizens  to remain calm in the meantime.<br>They have also promised to take this incident seriously,<br>and tighten the noose even further around the necks of<br>all Goat People.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2oHV0gi.png">
<p class="title">Chapter 10: Tales of the Goat People (No.10)</p>
<p class="para">Some hundred years ago, there was a girl who was detested<br>for being a Goat Person, and she lost her life at a young<br>age.<br><br>She had been trapped in a long cycle of reincarnation—such<br>is the story of us Goat People. She died, was reborn, lived,<br>died again, and was then reborn once more. Across the eras,<br>she changed form and lost her memories, but she was always<br>born with the same spirit.<br><br>It is said that even when she found a dreadful end as a Goat<br>Person, she retained her kindness the entire time. And that<br>most certainly is because her heart recalls the kindness of<br>what was called the Monster.<br><br>No matter how many times she is reborn, the Monster always<br>rescues her. The warm memories she holds of it slumber<br>eternally within her heart. And that is why, no matter where<br>or when she is born, she can press on, forever holding onto<br>her kindness.</p>
