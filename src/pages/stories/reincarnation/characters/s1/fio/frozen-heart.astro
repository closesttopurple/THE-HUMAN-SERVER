<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para"><i>It is a terrible, terrible monster. His body is jet-black armor, and he has twisted insect wings on his back.</i><br><i>And sometimes, the monster comes to this world and EATS people.</i><br><br><i>This is why we must all unite and fight him whenever he appears.</i><br>......<br>............<br>..................<br>As a light spring breeze dances through the plaza, four young girls sit around an open picturebook.<br>The image on the page displays an eyeless, ebon monster.<br><br>It resembles a large insect, yet is somehow uncannily human. The sight makes the hair of all who<br>see it stand on end.<br><br>The children take one glance at the picture and begin to scream with both terror and delight.<br>The tale of the monster has been passed down in this country for an age.<br>The picturebook which now entertains the four children is based upon it.<br>The girls enjoy themselves regardless—huddling close, laughing, scaring one another.<br>But then comes the sound of light footsteps—thin soles on flagstone.<br>The four girls look up from the book, their frigid gazes alighting on the source of the sound.<br>It is another girl, her hair tied back in pigtails.<br>Her head hangs low. On her neck and wrists are manacles and a collar, a symbol of her status as a<br>Goat Person.<br><i>Goat People</i>.<br>That is the name for this nation's lowest class of person.<br>The Goat girl attempts to hurry past the other children, trying not to look at them as she does.<br>And then...<br>"Hello."<br>The leader of the four gently calls out to the Goat girl.<br>The lone girl's face brightens.<br>The leader's personality can be a bit overbearing, but she is a good student, and her greeting sounds<br>both pleasant and sincere.<br>The Goat girl is delighted.<br>But as she is about to return the greeting, she falls forward.<br>Her words are swallowed by cobblestone and shame.<br>The leader has tripped her.<br>She looks at the Goat girl and laughs, and her friends soon join in.<br>Goat People are the lowest of the low; they are meant to be abused without reason or cause.<br>This idea has diffused itself among the young children.<br>The leader then speaks:<br>"We are honored to be in the presence of a Goat Person this day, girls! Now...shall we play Monster?"<br><i>Play Monster.</i><br>In this game, one child takes on the role of the monster while the others pursue them.<br>And, of course, the Goat girl is to take on the role of monster.<br>The other children throw the book at the lowly girl's feet.<br>The open page shows the dark monster standing by himself.<br>He is hated. Just as she is.<br>And so the girl begins to run. She runs and she runs and she runs—for she knows <i>terrible</i> things will happen<br>if she is caught.<br>As she flees for her life, she eventually comes to a desolate and aging ruin.<br>It is her precious, secret spot for play. Though it is typically worn and dirty, <br>beautiful flowers bloom here at this time of year.<br>After she ensures the other girls have not followed, she crouches down among the blossoms and<br>breathes a sigh of relief.<br>When her ragged breath finally calms, she lifts her head...<br>Only to be greeted by a surprising sight.<br>The man-eating monster stands before her with his jet-black body and hideous insect wings.<br>He waits silently among the colorful blooms.<br>"Are you...Mister Monster?" asks the girl.<br>Her voice is a whisper's memory.<br>He remains silent.<br>Suddenly, a thought comes to her:<br><i>We are the same.</i><br>The dark creature is her twin in all but name.<br>"Are you lonely, Mister Monster?"<br>She approaches him slowly.<br>Flowers dance in the wind around her feet.<br>"I think you are."<br><i>Poor Mister Monster. Everyone hates you just like they hate me.</i><br>She gently places her hand on the silent monster.<br>Strangely enough, she feels no fear.<br>What she sees in front of her is not some terrible brute, but a creature who is alone no matter where he goes.<br>A creature just like her. This is why she is not afraid.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para"><i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i><br>The Goat girl's light footsteps echo across the plaza.<br>She makes her way for the blossom-covered ruin.<br>Her secret spot where the monster waits.<br>"Hey. You."<br>A voice suddenly stops her in her tracks.<br>She turns to find the four girls who are always playing in the plaza.<br>The leader has called to her.<br>"You haven't been coming by lately. We miss you! Why don't you play Monster with us today?"<br>A cruel smile twists the corner of the girl's mouth as she speaks.<br>They want to play Monster with the Goat girl so they have an excuse to cause her pain.<br>The Goat girl's eyes drop to the ground. She takes a quiet step backwards.<br>"I'm sorry," is all she says before dashing away.<br>The children exchange bewildered glances.<br>The leader's expression twists further. Her mind reels.<br><i>That </i>Goat<i> disobeyed me! ME!</i><br><i>Also, she's been in a strangely good mood lately.</i><br><i>It makes me sick.</i><br><i>No Goat Person should ever smile like that.</i><br>The leader's eyes bore into the girl's back as she runs.<br>One. Two. Three.<br>One. Two. Three.<br>Red flower. Blue flower. White flower.<br>The girl's voice echoes throughout the ruin, which overflows with colorful flowers.<br>She moves around the aberrant monster, dancing ballet on a beat of three.<br>Only recently did girl and monster meet, yet already they are in perfect sync.<br>It's as if they are partners—as if they have been dancing together for the whole of their lives.<br>One. Two. Three.<br>The girl dances.<br>One. Two. Three.<br>Flowers nod.<br>One. Two. Three.<br>Wind blows. Petals flutter this way and that in the air.<br>Suddenly, the girl gasps in wonder, her dance coming to a halt.<br>Both she and the monster look to the sky.<br>They see petals soaring though the blue.<br>"Where do you think the flowers are going, Mister Monster?"<br>The monster does not reply. He is ever silent, never speaking.<br>But the girl feels she hears his answer regardless.<br>His voice is gruff, yet kind.<br>Time spent alone with the monster is unbelievably precious to the girl.<br>As a Goat Person, all she has ever known is abuse.<br>But this lonely monster makes no attempt to wound the girl.<br>This is why she hides away in the ruin.<br><br>It is so she does not have to face a painful reality.<br>Yet while this is all happening...<br>A lone figure hides among the crumbling walls, quietly watching the girl.<br>It is the leader of the children who play in the plaza.<br>She thought the Goat girl's pleasant mood strange, and so followed her in secret.<br>And when she came to the ruin, she beheld a most confusing sight.<br>The Goat girl was dancing by herself. Laughing by herself.<br><i>Mister Monster!</i><br>The leader watches in silence as the girl turns to empty space and calls to the monster over and over again.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The Goat girl's bindings garner cold stares as she walks through town.But she does not care.<br>For no matter what terrible things might happen, she has the companionship of a very kind monster.<br>Yet another day finds her racing down the street for the ruin where the monster waits.<br>Suddenly, she comes to a halt.<br>Smoke tickles her nostrils. Her face clouds. Something is on fire.<br>Knowing this bodes ill, she makes for the ruin as fast as she can.<br><br><i>I hope Mister Monster is okay</i>, she thinks to herself.<br>She soon arrives at the ruin.<br>It is ablaze.<br>Flames billow from a great pile of discarded junk. Broken chairs. Shattered clocks.<br>The flames lick at the flowers, threatening to turn everything to ash.<br>The ruin was meant to be a secret place for herself and the monster, and now it is lost.<br>"Mister Monster, no!" cries the girl.<br>She sounds as though she could start sobbing at any moment.<br>The monster is sitting listlessly in the middle of the ruin.<br><i>He's going to die.</i><br><br>But as she leaps into the flames to save him...<br>"She's here! The Goat is here!"<br>High-pitched laughter scratches the girl's ears.<br>She turns in the direction of the voice.<br>The four girls from the plaza are waiting for her.<br>Their leader takes a step forward, a lopsided smile on her face.<br>In her hand she holds a stick, the tip smoldering with flame.<br>She realizes these four are the ones who set the ruin to burn—the ones who stole her special place.<br>A black snake worms its way into her heart.<br>She has never felt such an emotion before.<br>"You're awful..." she mutters fiercely. "How <i>dare</i> you do this to Mister Monster!"<br>"Mister Monster?"<br>The children exchange glances and begin to snicker amongst themselves.<br>A moment later, the leader speaks.<br><br>"Your 'Mister Monster' doesn't exist, Goat. He's just a thing from a picturebook."<br>The leader had glimpsed the girl's secret.<br>She saw her playing by herself. <br>She saw her speak to empty air.<br>"You poor thing. You must have been so <i>lonely</i>!"<br>Her words tear at the Goat girl like glass.<br>"Don't you get it? You made the monster up!"<br>"......"<br>The girl remains quiet, her eyes glistening under tears.<br>But then...<br>"No. He's here. I know he's here."<br>She refuses to acknowledge it—she <i>cannot</i>. Doing so would mean her only friend does not exist.<br>"Are you okay, Mister Monster? You must be in so much pain."<br>With teetering steps, she enters the flames.<br>She finds herself entering an empty space.<br>Flames lick at her legs. Her arms. But she pays them no mind.<br>Because she can <i>see</i>.<br>She sees the monster sitting amidst the fire, his body covered in burns.<br>He is her precious friend.<br><br>Her hand brushes empty air.<br>But to her, it is the monster's cheek.<br>She crouches down to pluck a single burning flower at the monster's feet.<br>Hot fire chars her palm.<br>The pain is an idle thing. Distant. For she knows the monster suffers far more than she.<br><i>This is all </i>their <i>fault.</i><br>Her gaze rests on the burning flower.<br>Dancing flames reflect in dull eyes.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">The sun sets.<br>Darkness falls over the area. The once-dancing flames, now clinging to life, cast an eerie light on the ruin.<br>The children who started this fire are long gone, returned home to warmth and family.<br>They had amassed the junk and lit the spark.<br>The ruin—the secret spot for the girl and the monster—is now little more than a wreck.<br>The girl stands silent. Alone.<br>She stares at the monster, who is now a shriveled thing covered head to foot in burns.<br><i>Your "Mister Monster" doesn't exist.</i><br>The leader claimed the girl's monster was merely a vision.<br>But the girl never had any intention of acknowledging that truth.<br>Her monster is here. He is <i>right</i> here.<br>Yet the children filled the ruin with garbage and set it ablaze all the same.<br>They hurt her monster. <i>Hurt</i> him.<br><i>I will not let them get away with this.</i><br>A new emotion, dark and heavy, encroaches on her heart.<br>She picks up a piece of kindling and sets fire to the tip, creating a torch.<br>Then she begins to walk.<br>Her steps are unsteady, as though possessed by some entity.<br>She arrives at a beautiful house, a dwelling that resembles the magnificent homes<br>one might see in picturebooks.<br>It belongs to the leader of the children.<br>The girl lifts the torch.<br>Her mind whirls as she stares into the flame.<br>The leader of the children set fire to her ruin. She burned her monster.<br>Which means... Which means...<br>Which means she can destroy her home.<br>She can destroy what the other holds most dear.<br><i>Burn it all.</i><br>With darkness urging her on, she raises the torch high above her head and thrusts it forward.<br>Fire crackles. Sparks fly.<br>Before her, something begins to burn.<br>...It is the monster.<br>The torch never reaches the leader's house.<br>Instead...<br>The monster has leapt in front of her, letting the flames strike him.<br>Almost as though he is trying to stop her.<br>"Mister...Monster?"<br>The monster falls face-first onto the ground, his burning body writhing in pain.<br>"MISTER MONSTER!"<br>She rushes to him.<br>"I'm so sorry, Mister Monster! This is my fault! This is all my fault!"<br>All she can do is weep.<br>She repeats her apology as she clings to the monster's blazing body.<br>But then she realizes something...<br>The blaze enveloping him holds no heat.<br>Because the monster is nothing more than a figment of her imagination.<br>Somewhere deep inside, she had known this—yet acknowledging it was a weight too heavy to bear.<br>Because the kind monster had always been by her side.<br>And yet...she hurt him.<br>The monster's hand trembles and gently brushes her cheek.<br>It is incorporeal. Cold.<br>Yet she imagines warmth anyway.<br><i>He's so warm...</i><br>It is a strange warmth,<br>one that makes her feel the darkness which had overcome her heart is beginning to fade.<br>The monster's body quietly burns in the gloaming.<br>It twinkles. It shines. Finally, it turns to ash and begins the long ascent into the sky.<br>"Goodbye, Mister Monster."<br><i>I had so much fun.</i><br><i>I had fun dancing with you.</i><br><i>I...fun watching flowers...in the wind.</i><br><i>I...fun...you silently...my side...</i><br><i>And...</i><br><i>And...</i><br>The girl realizes something.<br>As the darkness that had encroached on her heart fades away, so too do her memories of the monster.<br>The monster has taken all of her twisted feelings with him.<br>"Thank you, Mister Monster."<br>Her memories dim, then fade. Soon the girl does not understand why she is crying at all.<br>Yet she continues to repeat herself. <i>Goodbye. Goodbye.</i><br>She does not fall silent until the final speck of ash has vanished into the heavens.<br>......<br>............<br>........................<br>The junk sits in a pile in the ruin.<br>The beautiful spring blooms are gone.<br>She is sad her secret place was laid to waste like this, but she is a Goat Person. It is to be expected.<br>She repeats this to herself as she begins cleaning up the junk.<br>"There we go," she says as she lifts a broken clock.<br>Suddenly she stops.<br>Her heart catches in her chest.<br>Beneath it, she finds a small flower still in bloom.<br>The rest are blackened ash, yet this one alone remains.<br>It shines brilliantly in the dark.<br>A strange feeling suddenly bubbles up in the girl's heart.<br><i>I miss you.</i><br><i>I don't know who you are...</i><br><i>But I miss you.</i><br><i>We'll play together when I see you again. We'll be even better friends.</i><br>Bewildered by the sudden well of emotion, the girl falls to her knees beside the flower.<br>She begins to pray.<br>She does not know the name of whom she misses, nor what they look like.<br>But whoever they are, they have given her such <i>warmth</i>.<br>And so, she prays she might one day see them again.</p>
