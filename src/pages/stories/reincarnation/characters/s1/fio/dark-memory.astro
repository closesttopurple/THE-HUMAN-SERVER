<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para">"Is this dress too garish?" My sister drew up her shoulders as she spoke, grasping the<br>hem of her beautiful white dress. It was generously decorated in layer upon layer of delicate lace,<br>with small diamonds sparkling here and there. I let out a small sigh as I stared at her.<br>"You look lovely, my sister. And well you should, for today is certain to be the finest day of your life."<br><br>My sister nodded, satisfied, and turned this way and that to better admire her reflection in the mirror.<br><br>We were twins, both princesses in the land we called home. Though we shared a visage,<br>my sister was bright, sociable, smart, and popular. She was the very image of perfection.<br>Whereas I was shy, dull, not at all clever, I didn't have many friends... I was wholly unremarkable.<br>This day, my sister was setting off on a journey to be wed to a foreign prince. It would be a<br>grand ceremony on a scale I had never seen. Our country and the prince's had long been at war,<br>you see, but this wedding would unite our families and finally bring an end to the seemingly<br>eternal conflict. It had all been set in motion by our mother—the queen.<br><br>The day was clear, and a warm sun sat high in the sky. Before stepping into the<br>jewel-studded carriage, my sister turned to take a final look at the castle where she was born and<br>raised.<br>"I will birth a son and raise the next king, Mother," she said with pride.<br>"So wait and stay safe until then."<br><br>With these words, she entered her carriage. Moments later, the carriage set off with great<br>pomp. It would be several days before she crossed the border, so she settled in for a long ride.<br>It sparkled in the sunlight, as though lighting the path ahead.<br><br>What a perfect beauty! What a perfect wedding! What a perfect prince!<br><br>I was so proud of my sister; seemingly nothing was beyond her reach, and she had accomplished<br>everything she ever set out to do in life. I knew her future would be bright, with nothing but great<br>things waiting for her. That's how her life always was, after all. I waved and waved until the<br>carriage vanished from view.<br><br>......<br>.........<br>............<br><br>The girl slowly opens her eyes. Then closes them. She had been dreaming again. In her<br>dream, she was a princess. She is disappointed that sleep has fled; she wanted to see more.<br>For even though she wasn't the lead princess in this particular dream, it was still much nicer<br>than her usual nightmares. Defeated, she opens her eyes, gazes for a moment at the foul,<br>grime-covered ceiling above, and rises from her shabby bed. Today, she will study hard, help<br>however she can, and spend another day being a very good girl.<br><br>"Good morning, Mommy. Do you wanna hear about my dream?"<br>She greets her mother cheerfully, as she does every day. The older woman does not even look up;<br>she just continues peeling potatoes.<br><br>"Dreams are nonsense, girl, and you've no time for such foolery. Now eat your breakfast and<br>get to school."<br>On the table is a bowl of thin gruel and a heel of bread. The girl sits on a rickety chair and pulls<br>the food close. The bread is hard enough to shatter teeth. But it's all Commoners like them can<br>afford, so she's quite used to it.<br><br>"Last night's dream was special, Mommy. I was a princess!"<br>Her mother sets a potato down and turns to stare at her daughter. Her eyes seem to bore holes in her.<br><br>"I told you to knock off that fool talk. You're a Commoner, not a Noble—and you never will be."<br>The girl is well aware of this.<br><br>Even the youngest child knows of the country's strict class system. Here, the disparity<br>between Nobles and Commoners is great indeed. The Commoners have long been discontent<br>with their lot in life, and the Nobles worry increasingly about social unrest. But the girl had no<br>wish to argue politics—she simply wanted to make conversation with her mother. Stung, she<br>drops her eyes and quickly finishes her breakfast.<br>"I'm going now, Mommy."<br><br>The girl hurriedly gets dressed, gathers her things,<br>and leaves the house for school. Winter. A most rainy season. Though the rain has stopped,<br>puddles still dot the road. She stands at one and looks at her face reflected in the water. She<br>does not look like her mother. Nor does she look at all like her father. She senses she is not<br>much loved by either. And she believes her face to be the reason. Suddenly angry, she stamps<br>on the face in the puddle and rushes off to school. She is determined to study hard and win her<br>parents' praise.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">The roses were finally blooming. From my window, I saw the bright red flowers stretching<br>out as far as the eye could see. The buds had been firmly shut for so long, but warm weather<br>had finally come yesterday to loosen winter's icy hold. But as magnificent as the flower garden<br>was, I had grown so very weary of looking at it. I had been staring at it since the day I arrived<br>in this country.... Since the day they locked me in this room. To pass the time, I started counting<br>the roses. When I reached the 48th rose, I spotted the prince walking alongside his young and<br>beautiful princess.<br><br>I knew the princess well. She was my twin, after all. A group of Nobles followed them,<br>chattering merrily away. The castle, a fun and lively place for most inhabitants, hosted a tea<br>party in the garden at this time every week. Delighted peels of laughter soon intermingled with<br>the clinking of porcelain. I quietly slipped out of view and listened in.<br><br>"You have been beaming with happiness every day since the wedding, Your Highness."<br>"People all across the land speak of the princess's beauty!"<br><br>It was true: The marriage of a prince from the west and my sister from the east was on the lips<br>of people in both countries. Of greatest concern was when she might bear him a child.<br><br>That was the reason I am here; the reason I was summoned to this place soon after the<br>wedding was complete. Because I...I am to birth the prince's child in place of my sister.<br><br>"Oh, I can hardly wait! Will it be a prince or princess?"<br>"No matter what, I'm certain it will be adorable."<br>"I've heard His Majesty the King has already prepared several midwives for the happy day."<br><br>It didn't take long for the prince and his court to realize his new bride was barren. So I was<br>smuggled into the country in the dead of night. No one could be allowed to know of my<br>existence. Of course, I would do anything for my sister. <i>Anything.</i>... I just thought she might<br>come see me at some point.<br><br>"The sun is beginning to set."<br>"You should not be out and about in the cold, Princess. Let us return to the castle at once."<br><br>As the crimson glow of dusk began to fill the room, the lively voices grew distant. It seemed<br>the party had ended. I moved from the window and began preparing myself for the prince's<br>arrival—for though my sister had not seen fit to visit, he arrived every night like clockwork.<br>And there, in that darkening room, I waited.<br><br>......<br>.........<br>............<br><br>The loud ringing of a bell pulls the girl back to reality. She had been unable to<br>concentrate during class; she kept thinking about last night's dream. The sun sits high in<br>the winter sky, its rays peeking through gaps in the clouds to brighten the classroom. It was<br>the continuation of her previous dream, the one where the princess rode off in a carriage.<br>The girl is yet young, and while she does not understand her dream completely, she knows<br>that Nobles sometimes have to do what their parents say and live a life not wholly their own.<br>In this way, she finds being a Commoner a relief. And once she is grown up, she hopes to live<br>a life of even greater freedom.<br><br>The school she attends is specifically for Commoners. Everyone, from the highest-ranking<br>teacher to the lowliest student, is still a Commoner at the end of the day. The classroom grows<br>lively as some of the more impatient children begin to gather up their textbooks.<br><br>"That's all for today," says the teacher.<br>"Oh, but before I forget, I have the results from last week's test."<br>The teacher looks directly at the girl and smiles.<br>"Your classmate here had top marks yet again. I hope you all learn from her and study hard!"<br>The girl happily hugs her textbook to her chest at the news. She runs the whole way home to<br>tell her mother.<br><br>"Mommy, Mommy! Guess what!? I got first on the test again!" Her mother is standing<br>in the living room with her back to her, holding a large mug in her hands. She slowly turns<br>around at her daughter's voice.<br>"If I study lots, do you think I could become a doctor or a lawyer?"<br><br>Her mother finishes off the contents of the mug—which is clearly some sort of alcohol—and<br>slams it down on the table. The scent of her breath fills the room like a cloud.<br><br>"Are you mad, girl?" she says loudly.<br>"We've not the money to let you study forever."<br>"Now clear your head of these fool dreams and get to the laundry!"<br><br>Dejected, the girl leaves to fetch the hamper. For a brief moment, a long-buried thought rises<br>up in the girl's chest: <i>What if she's not my mother? We look nothing alike, after all.</i> She shakes<br>the thought away. <i>No. I love her.</i> <i>Even if we aren't related by blood...</i> But the poor girl's desire<br>for love has no outlet, so it simply continues to swell painfully in her chest.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">Winter had arrived; the flower garden was cold and barren. But inside a heated room,<br>a newborn baby made its first cry.<br>"Oh dear. A girl."<br><br>The midwife holding the baby made no attempt to hide her disappointment; nor did the king<br>and prince, who were both leaning against a nearby wall. With sweat running down my body,<br>I instinctively reached out to hold the new life I created. But they do not even grant me that kindness.<br><br>"A shame," said the king.<br>"Very well. Dispose of her at once."<br><br>He and his son left the room without another word. But the princess—my twin sister—remained.<br><br>"You there," she said to the midwife.<br>"You are dismissed."<br><br>The woman froze in place for a moment. Then she set the baby down, bowed, and scuttled<br>out of the room along with the rest of the women who attended the birth. The last time my<br>sister and I were alone was a year ago—when I praised her exquisite wedding dress. But I lay still<br>and quiet in my bed, unsure if I should view this as a heartfelt reunion or begin begging for mercy.<br><br>"This is your fault, you know? What I'm about to do? If you'd just given birth to a son,<br>it wouldn't have come to this."<br>With that, my sister produced a small knife from her pocket...<br><br>............<br><br>Cradling my newborn daughter, I ran from the castle with only the clothes on my back.<br>My mind was chaos.<br><br><i>They were going to kill my daughter.</i> <i>My own sister was going to kill her! Why!? Why, why, why!?</i><br><br>I had no answer to this question. But then again, I'd never been especially bright. I came to<br>this wretched country for my sister's sake. I bore a child for my sister's sake. All for her sake.<br>All for her sake all for her sake all for her sake...<br><br>I had nowhere to go. A traveling merchant kindly allowed me to ride on his cart, and<br>after a night of hard travel, I woke up in a small border town. On the harsh midwinter morning,<br>a mixture of snow and sleet rained down without mercy or pause. Having pushed my body to<br>its limits right after giving birth, I was stricken with a high fever and fuzzy thoughts. But my<br>sweet daughter was warm and dry in a thick blanket, and as I held her to me, my troubles<br>seemed to dissipate. She was asleep. She looked just like an angel.<br><br>"Hey, there's someone on the ground over here!" I heard footsteps splash in a puddle<br>near my ear, and the voice of a young woman echo above my head.<br><br>"Heavens, she's got a baby..." Another voice called out—a man this time.<br>"Aye, I fear this girl's done for."<br>"Poor thing. To think she'll be leaving this child behind..."<br><br>They almost seemed to be talking about someone else. Apparently I collapsed, though I did<br>not remember it. I could hear my daughter crying nearby. Despite how hard the sleet was<br>coming down, I could do nothing for her; I did not even have the strength to stand. Thankfully,<br>someone had found us. With great effort, I turned my head and looked at the couple.<br><i>Please...raise her as your own. Make her happy.</i> The words I had intended to say never made<br>it from my mouth. The chill of the sleet pounding my body slowly faded away, the sound growing<br>distant...distant...distant... And finally, my conscious faded....Forever.<br><br>......<br>.........<br>............<br><br>The girl briskly walks through a bone-chilling cold. Her mother had sent her out to fetch<br>their bread ration. It's a rainy winter day—just like the one from her dream. She is wearing every<br>layer she owns, but the sudden downpour cuts through her garments like a knife. As she listens<br>to the never-ending torrent, she thinks back on the sight she dreamed of that morning. Now that<br>I think about it...<i>It's funny how the couple that found "me" on the ground looked a lot like Mommy<br>and Daddy...</i><br><br>"Mommy! I'm home!"<br>The girl, her pigtails dripping, produces three loaves of bread from the inside of her coat and<br>grins happily. The bread is a bit damp, but dry compared to the girl. Her mother, who was<br>warming herself at the hearth, takes the loaves with a bit of a guilty look.<br><br>"Thank you, girl. Now hurry up and get changed! You're dripping water all over the house."<br>As the girl slowly peels off her clothes, she only thinks of one thing: <i>I hope that made Mommy happy...</i></p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="para">"How long are you planning to sleep, child!? Get up already!"The woman throws the<br>bedroom door open. Her daughter, who usually wakes up on her own, has slept late into<br>the morning today. She stomps over to her tiny bed.<br><br>"Come now, get up. I need you to fetch the bread again."<br>The woman throws back the blanket on the bed to reveal the girl lying there languidly, her face red.<br><br>"M-Mommy... I think I'm sick..." croaks the girl.<br>"I'm cold and hot all at once...and I c-can't move..."<br><br>Her mother places a hand on her forehead. She is burning up. The woman immediately recalls<br>how she sent her out in the sleet the previous day to fetch their food. Then she emits a small<br>sigh and pulls the blanket back in place.<br><br>"Well then, never mind the bread. You just rest."<br>"Th-thank you, Mommy..."<br><br>As the woman gets up and makes to leave, the girl calls out to her weakly.<br><br>"Well?" says the woman.<br>"What is it?"<br>"I wanna slurpy apple," replies the girl in a pitiful voice.<br>"Is that okay?"<br><br>The woman stares at the child in the blanket. <i>She never asks for things</i>, she thinks. Without a<br>word, the woman closes the door behind her. And to request slurpy apple—a grated fruit treat<br>she used to make her when she was small—is even stranger.<br><br>She walks into the living room to find her husband peeling off his coat, still damp from<br>his turn on the watch.<br><br>"Raining again," he says.<br>"Awful stuff."<br><br>The woman places a bowl of warm soup on the table. Her husband peers down at it, clearly<br>disappointed, but she chooses to overlook this. With a small sigh, he digs into his meager meal.<br>But after a few moments, he suddenly puts the spoon down.<br><br>"Hey, how's the kid?"<br>"Feverish. I'm letting her rest today."<br>"I swear, that child is next to useless."<br><br>The woman sits opposite her husband and plucks an apple off the table.<br><br>"She came home soaked after her errands yesterday—probably what made her ill."<br>She picks up a small knife and begins peeling the fruit.<br><br>"You sent her out in <i>that</i>?" says her husband.<br>"Hells, the other guards won't even leave the barracks when it's coming down so."<br><br>The woman stops peeling and glares at her husband.<br><br>"Oh, so now I'm a magician who knows exactly when the rain is going to start and stop?"<br>Her husband wisely turns his attention back to his soup. The woman returns to her peeling.<br><br>"You know, she's not a bad kid," he says finally.<br>"You don't have to be so cold to her."<br>"Honestly, sometimes I feel like she's...wasted on us." <br><br>The peeled apple skin curls into a neat pile on the table.<br>"You're right there," she replies.<br>"Why, if she had our genes, she'd grow up to be a frightful beast just like us!"<br><br>The man looks down at his bowl again; silence was always his retreat when things weren't going<br>his way. The woman picks up the empty soup bowl, takes it to the kitchen, and returns with a<br>grater. She slides the apple against it, creating a harsh rasp.<br><br>"You know I hate it when she rubs our differences in my face."<br>The sound of the apple on the grater hangs heavy in the air.<br><br>"It's almost her birthday," says the husband. He stares out the window ask he talks.<br>The rain is coming down harder, turning into sleet.<br><br>"I mean, not like we know exactly when she was born..."<br>"But we found her on a cold, rainy day much like this one."<br><br>The grating slows as the apple is worn down to nothing.<br><br>"She's starting to look like her mother,"says the woman after a long pause.<br>"Won't be long until she realizes she don't look like us at all."<br>"Aye, that woman was a great beauty indeed."<br><br>The woman glares at her husband again, but says nothing. Instead, she gets up and tosses the<br>apple core into the sink. With the bowl of grated apple in hand, she returns to the girl's room.<br><br>Her face is still red, but she is at least sleeping. <i>Pity this poor thing ending up with<br>us when she could have lived a good, free life as a Noble.</i> The woman reaches out to touch<br>the girl's cheek, but stops. Instead, she places the bowl on the nightstand and leaves. The<br>girl is beginning to realize she is not their true daughter. And yet, she does all she can to<br>earn their love. But her looks aren't the only thing that set her apart; there is also her purity,<br>her honesty, and her bravery. The beauty of her very spirit tells the couple how different she is....<br>Perhaps they made a mistake taking her in that day. The apple sitting beside the girl begins to<br>brown. It grows darker still. Uglier. Horrid. But the girl notices nothing in her deep, deep sleep.</p>
