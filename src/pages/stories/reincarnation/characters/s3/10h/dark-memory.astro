<p class="title">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="para"><i>7:30 AM: Waking up and breakfast.</i><br>Report: This is your 335th day on duty.<br>You have accumulated a total of 8,016 hours of work time.<br>The voice rouses the girl from her slumber,<br>but she is not yet ready to get out of bed. She groans and rolls over.<br>Report: It is time to wake up.<br>Urging her to wake is a machine called a Pod,<br>a tactical support unit for androids like the girl.<br>Proposal: Get up.<br>Let me sleep...<br>The girl pulls the blanket over her head in an attempt to hide her face.<br>As she does, the loud <i>bang</i> of a gunshot rings out.<br>Startled, she bolts upright.<br>The red Pod floating before her set off a conical firecracker with its arm.<br>Colorful confetti flutters down around the two of them.<br>It's something of a salute from the Pod.<br>Report: Today marks eleven months since starting your mission.<br>Amidst the white walls, white floor, and white ceiling of the room,<br>the Pod pushes in a white cart.<br>On it sits a white plate, a white cup, fake white flowers in a vase,<br>and a cake covered with snow-white cream.<br>Report: Today is a special occasion.<br>As a treat, your breakfast today is cake.<br>It's her first time seeing a cake, and<br>she can't help giving a little gasp in awe.<br>It isn't necessary for androids to consume food—the girl<br>considers meals a bother. But cake is an exception.<br>She recalls that in the time of human civilization,<br>when people lived normal lives, cake was a particularly pleasurable treat.<br>She's always wanted to try it.<br>But isn't it a little odd to celebrate eleven months on the job?<br>Analysis: The number eleven is comprised of two ones.<br>Is that not a cause for celebration?<br><i>What a strange answer</i>, the girl thinks.<br>But it's as good an excuse as any, she decides,<br>especially if it means cake is involved. Not to mention...<br>These white flowers are so pretty.<br>She runs a finger across the petals of the fake<br>white flowers placed in the center of the cart.<br>Summary: These are modeled after flowers called carnations.<br>It's a pretty flower, its petals resembling a frilly skirt.<br>The Pod explains that in the era of human civilization,<br>in a particular region,<br>these flowers were a common gift children gave to their mothers.<br>Hypothesis: It might be an odd gift as I am<br>essentially like your mama, and you my child.<br>Oh, come on. There are no mothers or children among androids.<br>After a brief period of silly pedantry, the<br>Pod abruptly takes out a small contraption<br>from the lower shelves of the cart as though only just remembering.<br>Proposal: Let's take a celebratory photograph.<br>In the distant past, this item was<br>once called a "digital camera."<br>For whatever reason, the girl's<br>Pod enjoyed mimicking rituals from human civilization.<br>It would often go out of its way to recreate devices like this.<br>Oh, come on. We don't need to take a picture.<br>A bright flash from the camera immediately follows.<br><br>At least give me a heads-up. I'm sure I look stupid in that one!<br>She snatches the camera from the Pod to erase the photo.<br>She clicks through the device and looks at the contents<br>of the folder on the screen. When did the<br>Pod manage to take two pictures of her?<br>...Hm?<br>As she gazes at a photo, something unusual strikes her.<br>But before she can identify why,<br>the Pod snatches the camera back from her.<br>Alert: Refrain from touching things without my permission.<br>Devices from human civilization are very delicate.<br>I'm not so careless that it'll fall apart in my hands.<br>As she returns to finish her cake,<br>she thinks about what struck her as odd in the photo.<br>But finding no answer, she sets the thought aside.<br><i>8:00 AM. Routine inspection.</i><br>This facility is said to sit deep in the ocean depths.<br>This is because it stores priceless data on humanity.<br>The enemy cannot know of its presence.<br>The girl has been tasked with looking after the facility alone,<br>albeit with the help of Pods.<br>A dozen or so red Pods of the same model fly around<br>the server room, carrying out their inspections.<br>In total, the facility is home to several hundred Pods.<br>They all share the same intelligence, and so they all quibble similarly.<br>As the girl carries out a cursory inspection of the<br>servers, a Pod emits a sudden scold.<br>Proposal: Conduct your<br>work with a greater sense of responsibility.<br>Yeah, yeah. She brushes it off.<br>Internally, she curses it out.<br><i>I'm an android, you silly Pod.<br>I work for humanity too, you know.</i><br>Even so, the Pods handle most of the work.<br>She rarely has an opportunity to take charge.<br>She heaves a sigh and looks around her.<br>How dreadfully dull—white walls, white ceiling,<br>white floor. The only other colors are her<br>black clothes and the red Pods.<br>Oh?<br>Suddenly, the photo she saw earlier flashes in her memory banks.<br>At last, she realizes what was so odd about it.<br>There was something red in her pure white room,<br>and it wasn't the red of a Pod.<br>The carnations—<i>they</i> were red.<br>How strange. She tilts her head quizzically.<br>The carnations from this morning were white,<br>of that she is certain.<br>Could their red color in the picture have<br>been an artifact of ancient digital photography?<br><i>10:30 AM. Free time.</i><br>The girl sits on her bed and delves deep into her memory banks.<br>Perhaps she couldn't recall the color of the flowers she saw<br>only hours before due to a fault in her memory region.<br>As a precautionary measure, she conducts a scan.<br>Fearing one of her functions may have halted,<br>she scans deeper and deeper into her banks.<br>But she finds nothing anomalous. Her functions are perfectly<br>normal, and her systems are operating as they should.<br>She's certain that the flowers this morning were white,<br>yet the flowers in the photo were red.<br>Such a contradiction is impossible.<br>She delves deeper into her memory region, and there,<br>she discovers something she doesn't recognize.<br>Suspicious encrypted data.<br>She manages to decrypt and access it.<br>A video plays before her.<br>In the footage, the girl is infiltrating a<br>warehouse—a storage unit for spare Pods.<br>She then hacks into the Pod network and...<br>The footage after is corrupted. She cannot watch the rest.<br>The girl doesn't recall anything she sees in the video,<br>but without a doubt, it remains within her data.<br><i>Does this mean someone erased my memory?</i><br>But who? There's no one here besides her and the Pods.<br><i>11:30 AM. Investigation.</i><br>The girl makes her way to the warehouse.<br>Whether or not the memory in her memory region is real,<br>she can't say. But the fact that it was deliberately<br>encrypted and left there means there <i>must</i> be something here.<br>She suddenly notices a Pod beside her.<br>Query: What are you doing?<br>She gives a casual, noncommittal answer and<br>pushes open the warehouse door. Inside, she sees<br>several hundred backup Pod chassis.<br>Proposal: If you have no business here,<br>we should leave. We wouldn't want to damage these.<br>Yeah... You're right, she says.<br>She obediently pivots on her heel to leave.<br>The Pod follows her, and they leave the warehouse.<br>Suddenly—<br>With great vigor, she kicks off the ground and dashes back into the warehouse.<br>The Pod shouts to stop her, but it's too late.<br>The shutter falls between the Pod and the girl.<br>Whoops! Sorry about that, Pod.<br>It's a defense mechanism to prevent enemy infiltration.<br>She knew the Pod would follow her,<br>so she set its activation ahead of time.<br>She turns away from the shutter.<br><i>Why did the Pod try to stop me?<br>Coming into the warehouse shouldn't be a big deal.</i><br><i>Unless the Pod is hiding something from me.</i><br>She can no longer ignore the questions eating away at her.<br>In the exact same manner as in the encrypted video,<br>she begins hacking into the silent backup Pods.<br>Commencing System Check.<br>Memory Unit: Green.<br> Vitals: Green.<br> Pod Connection: Interrupted.<br>Systems Red.<br>Systems Red.<br>All System Greens.<br>The digital space is a field, white carnations proudly<br>blooming across its entirety. In all directions,<br>to the very horizon, there is nothing else.<br>This is the Pod network. The girl's hacking was successful.<br>She slowly walks forward.<br>What was that photo with the red carnations?<br>What was the mysterious data in her memory region?<br>And what are the Pods hiding?<br>She presses onward. With every step, the hologram<br>carnations that adorn the path gleam brightly.<br>And then, the girl sees a white shadow.<br>It is unclouded and even brighter than the flowers.<br>Appearing before her is an android, also clad in white.<br>This android has the exact same face as her.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="para">Within the facility that houses all of humanity's data,<br>the lone android custodian has questions.<br>The fact that her support Pod unit had a photo she had<br>no memory of sparked her overwhelming curiosity.<br>What could her Pod be hiding?<br>And so she infiltrated the Pods' network in search of the truth.<br>Inside, she comes face to face with a white shadow.<br>An android who shares her face but who wears clothes of the<br>opposite color. A mirror image, perhaps.<br>The girl does not know the android's identity.<br>Perhaps it is a derivative of her model developed unbeknownst to her.<br>But why is she wearing white when androids typically wear black?<br>Besides, this is the Pod network.<br>That an android is here at all is highly unusual.<br>The android in white stands among the brilliant hologram carnations,<br>her head drooped, her words delirious.<br>It's as though she doesn't even notice the girl.<br>Cautiously, the girl approaches her mirror image,<br>whose nonsensical speech comes to a halt.<br>She languidly lifts her head.<br>The two exchange a stare through their goggles.<br>Barely a second passes.<br>Suddenly and without warning, the mirror image slashes at the girl, destroying her arm.<br>You've gotta be kidding me!<br>The girl cries out and leaps backward, putting distance between<br>herself and her mirror image, readying herself for battle.<br>She then regenerates her severed arm.<br>This is, of course, the Pod network.<br>Her physical arm isn't lost if it's severed in this digital space—that is simply an anomaly<br>within a software program.<br>And as a Healer-type android, if there are any faults in the system,<br>she can carry out the repairs necessary to restore operation.<br>But the girl isn't given the luxury to ponder why this other android is attacking her.<br>The mirror image rushes forward. The flowers at her feet luminesce,<br>their petals dancing in the air. She closes in on the girl at a bullet's speed.<br>The girl activates her attack protocol and engages with the mirror image.<br>Her attack protocol manifests within the digital space as a sword.<br>Blades clash. The vicious blow from the mirror image leaves the girl's hands numb.<br>Her speed and swordsmanship are violence incarnate.<br>She is a hatred-spewing demon.<br>Her fragile white garb conceals an unimaginable amount of power.<br>The girl staggers back on her left foot. As a Healer, she is not particularly<br>suited for combat, be it in the physical world or a digital space.<br>On the other hand, although the android in white may share her face,<br>her movements suggest she is not a Healer.<br>If anything, she outperforms the combat-specialized Battler models.<br>This unit must have lost control.<br>This is the girl's conclusion. How would this android be able to<br>produce such devastating attacks otherwise?<br>The mirror image's arm shoots upwards, and her blade comes<br>down with such ferocious intensity that it shatters the girl's own.<br>The girl isn't given the slightest moment to reactivate her attack protocol.<br>Instead, she is fully focused on evading the mirror image's constant barrage of attacks.<br>Hold on... Time out!<br>But the enemy will never acknowledge her trembling cry.<br>The mirror image continues her flurry in a wild dance.<br>The android's blade flies near. The girl bends backward, narrowly dodging.<br>In that moment, she urges her thoughts on faster.<br><i>What do I do here?</i><br>I've got no clue... She's lived much of her life without having to think very hard,<br>much less strategize about deadly combat situations.<br>But one thing is for certain—without her weapon,<br>her only options are fighting bare-handed or dying. One option, then.<br>She makes adjustments to her motion control algorithm.<br>This will temporarily suppress her other functions,<br>but in this digital space, it will grant her access to exceptional strength.<br>In the brief window when the mirror image raises her sword,<br>the girl dashes forward and crushes her right arm.<br>With a sickening crunch, a red liquid splatters everywhere.<br>The mirror's arm, from the elbow down, falls to the ground along with her sword.<br>The dancing white flowers at their feet turn red.<br><i>I've got you now</i>, the girl thinks to herself.<br>But suddenly, there's a dull sound as her arm twists in a way it shouldn't.<br>The mirror image hit the girl with her torn upper arm.<br>Despite the adjustments the girl made to her output,<br>that strike alone is enough to destroy her own right arm.<br>But she can still use it.<br>The girl leaps into the air, using her broken arm to lash<br>like a whip at the mirror image's head.<br>The android staggers from the sudden attack. And then—<br>I can't do this! I'm not getting anywhere!<br>The girl darts off and begins her escape.<br>Though she intends to run, leaving the Pod network after going<br>through the trouble of hacking into it is no simple matter.<br>She makes her way to the deepest levels of the network.<br>After running for a while, she turns around. Her mirror image has not followed.<br>Perhaps the girl's last attack was more effective than she thought.<br>Or perhaps the mirror image simply felt no need to give chase.<br>Whatever the case, the danger is gone for the moment.<br>With a deep breath, the girl regenerates her broken arm.<br>She then steps into the deepest layers.<br>The brilliant white of the hologram carnations at her feet abruptly<br>changes color. Like a wave rushing over the shore, they're dyed a deep red.<br>The red reminds the girl of the Pods' chassis color.<br><i>Hey... Pod?</i><br>As she steps on the red carnations, she thinks of the nagging yet reliable robot.<br><i>You celebrated my anniversary with me. You gave me a delicious cake.<br>And pretty carnations too...</i><br>She presses forward, praying that the doubts in her heart don't portend something terrible.<br><i>I never particularly liked you, but you're always there to keep me<br>company in that lonely base. I was right to trust you, at least. Right?</i><br>She arrives at the deepest part of the network.<br>Android bodies are suspended in the air above the wildly blooming<br>red carnations, like darkly gleaming stars in the sky.<br>They float there, eyes closed and still, as though they slumber.<br>All of them look exactly like the girl.<br>As the girl stands before the uncanny sight, she murmurs—<br>What are you hiding, Pod?</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="para">The android girl manages the facility that houses all of humanity's data.<br>One day, she began harboring doubts<br>over the actions of the Pod that supports her.<br>Is her Pod hiding something?<br>She infiltrated the Pod network in search of the truth.<br>There, she encountered an android clad in<br>white with the exact same face as her.<br>The mysterious android suddenly and viciously attacked her.<br>Left with no other choice, the girl fled<br>into the deepest part of the network.<br>There, she found countless <i>hers</i>—bodies<br>that perfectly resembled her, suspended in the air.<br>She stares in shock at the android bodies.<br>What is this doing here, in the Pod network?<br>They <i>are</i> hiding something from her.<br>It's probably no big deal.<br>Or so she says to herself.<br>She can't imagine the Pods betraying her, so assuming<br>she learns the truth behind the bodies, it shouldn't be a problem. Right?<br>She slowly lifts her arms, then reaches out to<br>access the memories of the androids that look just like her.<br>As they load, the memories overtake the girl's consciousness.<br><i>These are my memories...</i><br><i>Things I should have experienced before...</i><br><i>Memories...</i><br><i>I run across a white floor.</i><br><i>Every day, every single day in this facility is so dreadfully boring.<br>But running through this place fills my chest<br>with a feeling far removed from boredom.</i><br><i>The door ahead draws near. Once I open it, I can escape.</i><br><i>But this facility sits at the bottom of the ocean so<br>that the enemy will never find it, meaning the ocean lies beyond that door.<br>If I open it, the water will crush me with the weight of a thousand atmospheres.</i><br><i>But if I stop here, they'll kill me. My only choice is to open the door.</i><br><i>I grab the knob.</i><br><i>High-voltage electricity burns my hand.</i><br><i>But I don't care. Pain doesn't matter to me.<br>I scream my throat raw and rip open the door.</i><br><i>But water doesn't rush in.</i><br><i>What I see instead is an azure sphere.<br>A beautiful planet—Earth—gleaming a brilliant blue.</i><br><i>It sits there silently, floating in dark space.</i><br><i>Now I see. This isn't the deep ocean at all, but...the moon.</i><br><i>So that too was a lie. In the end, everything was a lie.</i><br><i>I figured out what they were hiding—humanity has already died out.</i><br><i>But the Commander is feeding us false information,<br>and we continue to fight for those who no longer exist.</i><br><i>There's nothing left for us to protect, yet we androids are made to fight for a lie.</i><br><i>It's so sad that humanity is gone...</i><br><i>But I think there's something even sadder.</i><br><i>I raise my hands in surrender.</i><br><i>The horde of red Pods reach out to me with their arms.</i><br><i>Those same arms brought me breakfast each morning and played chess with me.<br>And now that I've learned the truth, they're going to kill to me.</i><br><i>I can't run anymore.</i><br><i>The approaching red reminds me of the carnation.</i><br><i>I was so happy when Pod gave me those red<br>flowers for my eleven-month anniversary.</i><br>..................End of data.<br>The girl's consciousness returns to her.<br>When she accessed one of the floating bodies, its memories flooded into her.<br>Once the vision fades, she steps back with trembling legs.<br>This can't be. It has to be some kind of mistake.<br>But when she accesses the memories of the other bodies,<br>she finds they all contain the same data.<br>Whenever she finds out the truth, the Pods attack her and delete her memory.<br>And so she forgets everything. Everything is taken from her,<br>even the sliver of sadness at the very end. It's all gone.<br>This has happened countless times.<br>Indeed, the bodies floating before her are the remains of her<br>consciousness data, all that has been erased thus far.<br>How sad...<br><i>I trusted you, Pod.</i><br>The girl senses someone behind her.<br>She turns around to see her mirror image, the android girl<br>clad in white, who must have caught up to her at some point.<br>She stares into space, muttering nonsense under her breath.<br>Her right arm, which the girl previously destroyed, has regrown,<br>and in her hand is a military sword drenched in a red liquid.<br>Who are you, really?<br>The girl takes slow steps toward her mirror image.<br>But suddenly, the mirror image leaps forward.<br>Her blade draws an arc through the air directly toward the girl.<br>But the girl does not flee. She does not dodge.<br>She takes the blade to her chest.<br>Red liquid pours from her. She feels...pain.<br>Her old self, clad in white, feels the same hatred as when<br>she learned that the Pods betrayed her.<br>The girl understands when she accepts the blade—the mirror<br>image is another piece of consciousness data that once belonged to her.<br><i>Why...?</i><br>The mirror image's fading voice melts into the girl.<br>With the blade still plunged through her heart, the girl<br>reaches out to pull the android into an embrace.<br>Look, I get it—the desire to lash out, I mean.<br>Because you're me.<br>She found that the sadness she felt at the very end of each<br>memory she accessed was always the same,<br>no matter how many times her memory was wiped.<br><i>Pod played me for a fool this entire time.</i><br>I know. You were devastated.<br>She speaks with the mirror image as though<br>answering her own questions.<br><i>I...will never forgive them for what they've done.</i><br>I'm sure they had their reasons. We should talk with them.<br><i>But once they erase your memory, it's over. It's always...<br>It's always been this way.</i><br>But...<br>The mirror image pulls the blade from the girl's heart.<br>She takes the girl into her arms as she<br>collapses and presses her cheek to the wound.<br>But the Pods were always looking out for me.<br><i>It was all a lie.</i><br>They taught me so many things.<br><i>It was all a lie.</i><br>The mirror image's fingers pry apart the girl's wound and press in.<br>Pain controls her body. Her breath becomes ragged in the burning torment.<br>Pod celebrated my anniversary with me.<br><i>It was all a lie.</i><br>Pod gave me a carnation...<br><i>It was all a lie.</i><br>I...<br>As she teases the girl's wound, the mirror image's fingertips,<br>hands, and arms fade into specks of light and meld into her.<br>The mirror image's body eventually scatters like mist, slipping inside the girl.<br>Once she accepts the pain, the hatred,<br>and the sadness...it starts to feel good.<br>The two androids become one.<br>Her black clothes slowly fade to white.<br><i>...I trusted Pod.</i><br><i>Pod used me. Like a heartless<br>puppet. Like a disposable toy.</i><br><i>They think nothing of me.<br>They've erased my memory over and over.</i><br><i>It was a lie. It was all a lie.</i><br>The shadow of the last remaining white<br>carnation in the sea of red mutters to herself, like a mantra of madness.</p>

<p class="para">Report: From Pod 006 to Pod 006.<br>Sharing the situation with you. She has learned of the truth again,<br>the poor thing. This is the 54th time.<br>She learned that humanity is no more.<br>How many times have we had to erase her memory?<br>She is currently in our Pod network.<br>In the deepest levels, I might add, where we store the remains<br>of her previously deleted consciousness data.<br>Yes, this is an emergency.<br>Upon learning the truth, her hatred consumed her.<br>She found a fragment of her past consciousness data<br>that was wandering the network—her white shadow.<br>She has incorporated it and merged with it.<br>That's bad.

Even noticing<br>that the girl has been dyed in the white of hatred, it does not waver.<br>They are inside the Pod network. As such, the Pod is aware of everything that happened to the girl.<br>And it knows what will happen next.<br>As the Pod switches to long-range-fire mode, the girl dashes forward with blade in hand.<br>The Pod opens fire, its heat ray burning the hologram flowers.<br>With clever movements, the girl dodges the ray and closes in on the Pod.<br>The Pod switches to close-quarters-combat mode.<br>Its four arms meet the girl in battle.<br>Sparks fly. Arms and blade clash.<br>The Pod is sent hurdling into the air and explodes.<br>A shockwave rushes past the girl,<br>but she pays it little mind. She points her blade behind her.<br>There, too, is another red Pod.<br>Hundreds of Pods of the same model are deployed throughout the facility,<br>and that's true of this digital space as well.<br><i>Why?</i><br>She cuts the Pods down one after the next,<br>but they keep coming without end. She growls.<br><i>Why...</i><br>She yells as she brandishes her sword.<br>Her despair and hatred only grow as she carries out her destruction.<br><i>Why!?</i><br>She looks to the sky. Beneath her visor,<br>her eyes take in the countless black shadows,<br>the remnants of her deleted consciousness data.<br>She is furious.<br>Why store the remains of her deleted data here, even when the<br>Pods will erase her memory after all of this?<br>Why is it in a place like this, in the Pods' own network?<br>Without them, she never would have learned the truth.<br>She never would have learned that the Pods were deceiving her,<br>or that humanity's extinction was being hidden.<br>She could have kept living on in boredom in the facility.<br><i>I'll destroy you...

Its voice sounded human.<br>Suddenly, the digital space shimmers.<br>A wind cuts through them. Petals tear from the hologram<br>carnations, fluttering into the air and transforming into countless Pods.<br>The red mechs spread toward the sky like a flower in bloom.<br>They serve as a shield for the girl's remaining consciousness data.<br>This is...my sanctuary. Please don't destroy it.<br>Pod sounds unusually desperate, and the girl is shaken.<br>But it's not enough to ease her hatred.<br><i>That's always how you've tried to trick me.</i><br>She reaches for the consciousness data that the<br>Pods want so badly to protect. In that moment, all her memories flood into her.<br>Memories of eating breakfast with Pod.<br>The way Pod was so particular with how the toast was done,<br>how the coffee tasted, even though the girl could hardly care less.<br>Even so, it was fun.<br>Memories of playing chess together.<br>Neither were all that good, both often going back on their<br>moves with a "let's pretend that didn't happen."<br>It was all meaningless, simply a way to kill time.<br>Even so, it was fun.<br><i>Ah... Aaahhh...</i> In the flood of memories, the girl draws back.<br>Just as her memory is taken from her,<br>she's overwhelmed by that familiar sadness.<br>Sadness about humanity's extinction.<br>Sadness that Pod betrayed her.<br>But she realizes something else.<br>It's because of her joyful memories that she feels sadness.<br>She is sad that she will lose her fond memories with Pod.<br>I couldn't get rid of them because they're...precious memories.<br>Pod speaks to the girl.<br>It tells her that androids fight for humanity,<br>so if they were to learn that humanity has died out,<br>it believes they would lose their will to fight.<br>But instead, the girl is profoundly hurt.<br><i>If we learn the truth, androids won't fight...</i><br>The girl mulls over Pod's words and then poses a question.<br><i>But you know the truth, Pod, and you're still fighting.</i><br>Even if humanity is gone, we must<br>keep protecting all that humanity has left behind.<br><i>Then I wish you hadn't kept that from me.</i><br>If only. If only...<br><i>I would've fought by your side, Pod.</i><br>I'm sorry. Pod squeezes out an apology.<br>I'm truly sorry.<br>It sounds as though it's crying. It hardly matters<br>that its mechanical body cannot produce tears—Pod is crying.<br>Let's fight together.<br>The girl reaches for Pod. Light spills from her pale frame.<br>Now that she has learned Pod's true feelings,<br>the white-hot hatred fades from her.<br>I've only ever been terrible to you.<br>Will you still fight alongside me?<br>Pod hesitates. The girl gently places her hand on its arm.<br>Standing there now is a girl who wears the colors<br>of an android who fights on behalf of humanity—black.<br>Their hands intertwine, and they vow to fight on together.<br>Commencing System Check.<br>Memory Unit: Green.<br>Vitals: Green.<br>Pod Connection: Enabled.<br>All System Greens.<br>Report: This is your 366th day on duty.<br>You have accumulated a total of 8,760 hours of work time.<br>The girl awaits breakfast, anticipation in her chest.<br>Today is her one-year anniversary since starting this duty.<br>And considering the occasion, she imagines she'll<br>get to have the same kind of cake she had on her eleven-month milestone.<br>But on the cart is her usual breakfast—toast and coffee.<br>She is clearly disappointed.<br>Report: I'm sorry. We ran out of cake ingredients last month.<br>We'll have to wait for a restock.<br>Oh, come on! You should've given me a cake on <i>the</i> anniversary,<br>not on an almost-but-not-quite anniversary like eleven months.<br>This is a whole year! Isn't that way more special?<br>Alert: Good grief. Be thankful for every meal.<br>There was a reason why Pod decided to celebrate eleven months, <br>and that was because the girl always<br>realized the truth just shy of her one-year anniversary.<br>Pod wanted to celebrate with her before it had to erase her memory.<br>But it no longer had to worry about such things.<br>Proposal: We will celebrate with cake next year.<br>Ugh, it's not like I'm asking you to celebrate, the girl<br>pouts, bashfully sinking her teeth into the toast.<br>Once breakfast is over,<br>Pod returns to the kitchen to put the utensils away.<br>There sits an artificial red carnation,<br>but Pod doesn't recall having put it there.<br>Oh, my. Has someone brought this in for me?<br>Pod wonders.<br>It gently strokes the flower's petals and smiles.</p>
