<p class="title">Chapter 1: Escape (No.01)</p>
<p class="para">Man, what a day.<br>I almost miss all the boredom I was so used to.<br><br>As I brandish my blade at the enemy, I think about all<br>the dull days I spent with Mama. With Pod.<br><br>For long days and months over decades, we kept watch<br>together over the server on the lunar base that housed all<br>of humanity's data.<br><br>But nothing noteworthy happened during that time. Day in and<br>day out, all we did was prepare for an emergency that might<br>occur one day. It was so boring that there were times when<br>I wasn't sure if I was alive or dead.<br><br>But the day finally came. The day to fight back the enemy<br>that attacked the server was finally upon us.<br><br>"Great... There's more of them."<br><br>I talk to myself in an attempt to inspire myself to fight.<br><br>Ordinarily, this level of emergency would require immediate<br>decontamination. But my job right now is to hold this area<br>while the sun and moon are conjunct, opening the path so<br>that Pod and my other friends from The Cage can reach<br>Earth safely.<br><br>In truth, I wanted to see Earth with my own eyes alongside<br>everyone. But...<br><br>I left my body back on the base, and it broke a long time<br>ago. The body I have now, a facsimile in this virtual space,<br>is glitchy and corrupted. Countless error codes obscure<br>my vision and hearing.<br><br>Every part of me is at its limit—my body, my consciousness data.<br>Everything that makes me who I am is nearing its breaking point.<br>That's tantamount to death.<br><br>But it's so strange. I know I'm going to die soon, but I've<br>never felt so alive. Ever. Is this what it means to die?<br>No... I think this is what it means to <i>live</i>.<br><br>The blade feels awkward in my hands, but that's hardly<br>a consideration as I brandish it to my enemies. My<br>swordsmanship is so clunky it even makes <i>me</i> laugh.<br>But you know what? That's fine. The tip of my blade is<br>meeting its target regardless.<br><br>As a Healer type, I wasn't originally suited for combat,<br>but I added a little upgrade to my OS for this day alone.<br><br>Slowly but surely, I dispatch one enemy after another.<br>It's my tenacity that keeps me going. I <i>will</i> see<br>my friends to Earth. That thought alone drives my will.<br><br>I'm surprised at how powerful a weapon attachment to such<br>a thought can be. I somehow manage to successfully keep<br>the enemies at bay around me.<br><br>...But it's not over yet.<br><br>Snow begins to fall. A light flurry soon grows into a<br>blizzard. White smudges appear on the digital flagstone.<br><br>The sharp peal of a bell echoes around me. It almost sounds<br>like it's ringing in celebration, but I know it's not.<br><br><i>Here it comes!</i><br><br>The bell heralds the emergence of an even more powerful<br>enemy. My hand around my sword handle grips tighter.<br><br>"Whoa, wait. What...is <i>that</i>...?"<br><br>I speak despite myself.<br>I've never seen anything like this before.<br><br>Countless flying enemies form a mass against the sky.<br>They all look like...giant babies.<br><br>"<i>Mama... Mama...</i>"<br><br>The babies babble the same word over and over again.<br>The echoing whispers settle heavy and dark inside of me.<br>It's creepy, yes, but more than that, my intuition tells me<br>that this is <i>bad</i>.<br><br>The babies fly toward me and begin their destruction,<br>feeding on the structure of the virtual space, all the<br>while laughing, crying, and playing innocently.<br><br>"Damn it!"<br><br>I try to fight back, but my body is at its limit.<br>I have nothing to fight the babies back with.<br>They devour my body too.<br><br>My legs that walked alongside my friends. My hands that<br>reached out to my friends. They are mercilessly made into<br>food. Clear as day, I feel the end approaching.<br><br>...Man, what a day.<br>A long day that's going to end in my death.<br><br>My consciousness data crumbles. As it does, the endless<br>babble of <i>Mama, Mama</i> resonates within me.<br><br>And I...can't believe myself. Now, of all times, I think<br>back to the modest times I spent together with Pod.<br><br>We'd been having breakfast together like always when she<br>tried to get me to call her "Mama." I rebelled—<i>ugh,<br>that's so stupid, that's so embarrassing</i>—and I refused<br>to entertain her.<br><br>But at the end of the day, I think Pod <i>was</i> like<br>a mother to me.<br><br>"If only I could've called you that just once."<br><br>I don't know if my voice is even working anymore.<br><br>"Mama...I wish I could see you again..."<br><br>Yet I squeeze out what words I can.<br><br>"...I want to live."<br><br>I don't know if I have hands anymore.<br>Yet I reach out for the pure white snow.<br><br>"I want to live."<br><br>I need to call Pod "Mama." And until I can—<br><br>"I want to live. I waNt to LivE. I wAnT t0 <i>LIvE</i>!"<br><br><br>484f50454c4553532041<br>4c495645205245545552<br>4e20484f4d45204d4f4d<br><br><br>Endless silence. Eternal nothingness.<br>When my consciousness data vanished, it all ended.<br>Everything.<br><br>The entirety of my data disperses through the digital space,<br>and the connection with the world I just barely managed to<br>establish is severed. I understand, at long last, that this<br>is death.<br><br>So why is there still a faint glimmer of consciousness here?<br><br>A long time passes. A day, maybe. A month. A year?<br>Years, maybe. Or centuries. My mechanism that tracks time<br>is already gone, of course. But instinctively, I understand<br>that a long time is passing me by.<br><br>Then, a hypothesis comes to me. Maybe the reason I've<br>managed to hold onto consciousness is because, on the<br>brink of death, I clung to my desire to live.<br><br>And as I endure eternity, I still hold fast to it.<br><br><br><br>...And then, at long, long last, new data is born in the<br>wreckage of the digital space—in this nothingness—and<br>I can control it.<br><br>I create my own virtual body. My arms, my legs, my torso—<br>even logic circuits worthy of the human mind.<br><br>If I stop to think about it, it's all so strange—the logic<br>circuits are the core of an android's thought process.<br>Yet even without any, I could still think with this<br>consciousness and build new logic circuits with my<br>own hands.<br><br>But that's not enough. I want a place where I can exist.<br>Even if I have a body, having nowhere to <i>be</i> might<br>as well be like not existing at all.<br><br>And so, next, I build myself a home in the nothingness.<br>It is a vast, white space devoid of anything at all.<br>This is the origin of all things, if you will.<br><br>I reach into the air and clench my fist. Excellent—my body<br>works. I stomp on the empty floor with the sole of my shoe.<br>Okay—things are looking good in this space.<br><br>And then, in an act of self-inspiration,<br>I throw my arms wide.<br><br>...All right. Now I've got to get back to Mama and the<br>others, somehow.<br><br>I must find a way to get out of this broken virtual<br>space―this world of nothingness. Which means...<br><br>Everything must start here.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 2: Exploration (No.02)</p>
<p class="para">Here, at the end of the journey I walked alongside Pod and<br>my friends from The Cage, I remained alone in the digital<br>space connecting the lunar base and Earth to ensure that<br>everyone else could reach their destination. Combat has<br>never exactly been my forte, but I managed to stop the<br>enemy's advance.<br><br>Then, out of the blue, massive babies appeared.<br>They destroyed the entirety of the virtual space,<br>along with my own data.<br><br>But I suppose my tenacity of purpose had an effect.<br>After what felt like an eternity, I successfully managed to<br>revive myself. And with that, I gained the power to create<br>things in this digital space.<br><br>The first thing I created was my own body. Then I created<br>an empty white space. It was a little lonely, but I'm used<br>to places like this. Plus, it reminds me of the lunar base.<br><br>I made a vow: I'm going back to Mama and the others.<br>I just need to figure out a way to do that...<br><br><br><br>Through trial and error, I learn how to create all sorts<br>of things.<br><br>I create little blocks, construct boxes, and then piece them<br>together to make a small hut. Nice. This will be my house<br>from now on.<br><br>One day, I will leave this space and return to my original<br>world. To do so, I want to be able to use these abilities<br>to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>Every time I create something, I think about the weapon<br>memory data stored in The Cage. I recreate all the wonderful<br>things I witnessed in them.<br><br>The pretty hairpin the hunter gave to her little sister.<br>The school dorms where the mage children once lived.<br>The splendid palace that stood between sand and sea.<br><br>But something is missing from all these things.<br>And that's because... I'm alone.<br><br>No sister to give a hairpin to, no friends to live through<br>the pains and joys of school life with, no lover to whisper<br>sweet nothings to in the palace...<br><br>I have no one.<br><br>I'm used to acting on my own for my duty, but now that<br>I think about it...I had Pod with me back then.<br>I <i>wasn't</i> alone.<br><br>Right now, I can create all sorts of things. But I highly<br>doubt I can make complicated machines like the pods,<br>much less life itself.<br><br>"Oh, right!"<br><br>I clap my hands.<br><br>I don't have to create machines or life—I have friends.<br>Ones who kept me company in my long, dull days working<br>on the moon base.<br><br>"Strike while the iron is hot," or so an ancient human<br>saying goes. I get to work right away.<br><br>I create a massive library. It's empty—there are no books yet.<br>But around me, countless bookshelves spring into being like<br>music from piano keys.<br><br>Here, I will start writing books. Lots of them.<br>I will fill this entire library.<br><br>I had friends who kept me from being lonely.<br>They were part of the countless tales I read in The Cage.<br><br>I've never written a story before...but I've read so many<br>wonderful tales. I <i>should</i> be able to write something<br>of my own.<br><br>First, I think about the outline of the story I want to create,<br>and then I put every single turn of events into words.<br><br>The letters I make swim through the air, drifting like music,<br>blooming like flowers. The letters dancing through the air<br>eventually form sentences.<br><br>I firmly and carefully bind the letters together so that<br>they will not come apart or break. I breathe life into<br>everything—I give them history, I give them meaning,<br>and I create my story.<br><br>It's a tale of a lone girl facing hardship. I was inspired<br>by a story of a girl that I read a long time ago on the<br>lunar base.<br><br>When my piece is finally finished, I bind it together as<br>a book and place it on the empty shelf. And then—<br><br>"Huh!?"<br><br>A strange light gleams before me, and despite myself,<br>I raise my voice. A light spills from the book I'd just put on<br>the shelf. It's a warm light. The light spreads, envelops me,<br>and takes on the shape of a person. And eventually,<br>it shows itself to be a girl.<br><br>Her lips are drawn into a thin, firm line.<br>She stares at me silently.<br><br>A human? I didn't think I could make humans.<br>But here she stands, right in front of me.<br><br>"Did you...come from the story?" I ask with hesitation. She<br>looks <i>exactly</i> like the main character of my story.<br> <br>"<i>I...don't...know...</i>"<br><br>"Ah!" I have a little eureka moment when I hear her<br>trembling voice.<br><br>Hold on a sec. I just made life, didn't I! Go, me!<br>Am I a god!?<br><br>"Hey. Can you tell me about yourself?"<br><br>I try to hold back my excitement—I don't want to shock her.<br>But despite my best efforts, I bombard her with a deluge of<br>questions.<br><br>"Can you tell me your name?"<br>"Do you have any memories?"<br>"Do you know who I am?"<br><br>But...<br><br>"<i>Ah... Ah... Aaah...</i>"<br><br>Suddenly, the girl morphs into a lump of what looks like<br>black jelly. I exclaim in surprise, step back, and the<br>girl's body vanishes in a sudden burst.<br><br>What does it mean? I can't even begin to say.<br>Did she die...? Maybe she was never alive to begin with.<br>I look at her goopy remains, and my shoulders droop.<br><br>I don't understand why she vanished.<br>But...I have a hunch.<br><br>It must be because I didn't write the story very well.<br><br>I stare at the floor for a few moments, but I quickly pull<br>myself together and think more positively.<br><br>I don't have time to be upset about this. I simply have to<br>write an even better story next time. And if I keep at it,<br>then maybe one day I'll have another friend of my own.<br>Like the brother and sister I traveled with in The Cage...<br>Someone I'd be proud to call my friend.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 3: Elimination (No.03)</p>
<p class="para">Enormous babies appeared in the digital space connecting<br>Earth and the moon. Even as they consumed me, I held<br>strong to my desire to live.<br><br>After quite some time, my wish came true. I managed to<br>restore my consciousness data in this virtual space.<br><br>I gained the power to create objects here. I created a space<br>out of the nothingness, and I built a town to live in,<br>but...something was missing.<br><br>After considerable thought, I created a library without<br>books. I decided to write stories to fill the empty shelves<br>personally. It'd be nice if these stories could be my<br>friends, I thought.<br><br>And when I finished writing the first story, the main<br>character materialized and appeared before me.<br><br>Aren't I incredible? I was overjoyed, but my elation only<br>lasted a moment—the main character vanished in a blink.<br><br>That was...unfortunate. She wouldn't have disappeared had<br>I been able to write a better story.<br><br>She could have kept me company in this empty space.<br><br>I wish I had friends.<br><br>They don't have to do anything special. I'd be content just<br>sharing breakfast together. Just like Pod, back on the lunar<br>base...<br><br>After that, I begin to write frantically. But after countless<br>books, I still haven't created anything I'm satisfied with.<br><br>Something is missing, but I don't know what.<br><br>What I'm doing over and over again <i>isn't</i> creating<br>stories. Rather, I'm simply copying the facade of the memories<br>in the weapons that I read so long ago on the lunar base.<br><br>Does this mean I have no talent?<br><br>I place another good-for-nothing book on the shelf as I feel<br>the irritation build in me. As I do, one of the books from<br>the stuffed shelf falls and hits me on the head.<br><br>It's just one thing after another, isn't it?<br>My frustration explodes.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>I spent so many days in the base reading weapon memories...<br>I thought I could put that experience to good use.<br>I thought <i>I</i> could write nice stories too.<br><br>I have no outlet for what I feel toward my incapable self.<br>I lend myself to my anger and furiously write new stories.<br>All I do is write more and more botched stories,<br>stuffing them one after another on the shelves.<br><br>One day, I find one of the books on the shelves emitting<br>a bright light.<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>I'm almost embarrassed by how delighted I sound.<br>I recognize that light... That's the signal that one of<br>the characters from the story is about to appear.<br><br>A friend was finally coming to life! Or so I thought.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>The light grows dimmer and muddier, and a dark aberration<br>appears before me—an enemy I had seen so many times before<br>in The Cage.<br><br>It stands there, staring blankly down at me.<br>Its eyes are empty—I can't tell if it's dead or alive.<br><br>"Just great."<br><br>I immediately form a sword in my hands.<br>Who knows how long it's been since I've held a weapon,<br>but I'll just have to manage somehow.<br><br>But my attacks don't work on the enemy.<br>If anything, whenever my blade makes contact with it,<br>it only swells larger.<br><br>"I don't get it!"<br><br>Its enormous body shivers and it begins to thrash about.<br>Countless books fall from the shelves, and shredded pieces<br>of paper flutter through the air like snow. It destroys the<br>floor, the ceiling, the bookshelves, the library. It breaks<br>my town, my sky, my sea. It shatters everything without<br>mercy.<br><br>Like water seeping from a broken vessel,<br>I watch as the world I created vanishes into nothing.<br><br>My attacks aren't enough to stop the enemy.<br>I'm out of ideas.<br><br>There's an old human saying: "She who runs away may live<br>to fight another day." So, I escape the world I created.<br><br>I escape to a place outside of my world.<br>I float through the empty nothingness and think to myself.<br><br><i>Man. The world I worked so hard to create was taken from<br>me by an enemy I created myself... But it's fine, I guess.<br>All I have to do is create a new home. Then I'll write a new story.</i><br><br>I heave a sigh and look behind me—I can see my world<br>breaking apart.<br><br>A gleaming white, shattering star.<br><br>The world... The world I created.<br>It resembles something familiar to me.<br><br>Oh, that's right. The moon. Long ago, Pod and I spent all<br>our time on that little satellite. Pod said that when you<br>look up to the night sky from Earth, you can see parts of<br>the moon gleaming white.<br><br>Glitches and corruption eat away at the world I created as<br>it darkens. I'm sure the enemy is still rampaging, making a<br>whole mess of my town, my library, my books—everything.<br><br>...You know what? I don't have to put up with this.<br><br>I tighten my grip on my sword.<br><br>I can't bear seeing my world—all the stories I wrote—be<br>destroyed.<br><br>Because that world—those stories—came into being all because<br>of the weapon memories that Pod and I once worked so hard to<br>protect.<br><br>No matter how shoddy they are, I could never abandon them.<br><br>My impulses push me forward, and I turn back to my world.<br><br>The enemy still rampages. It throws its massive,<br>darkened form around haphazardly and wreaks havoc.<br><br>The reason the enemy was born—or rather, the reason it<br>failed to live—must be because I was writing in anger.<br>Because all I wanted to do was write well, so I ignored<br>everything I <i>truly</i> wanted to write about—my pain,<br>my sadness, my kindness, my pain...<br><br>I hadn't been able to give the poor thing life.<br>And now it's an empty monster.<br><br><i>I know what to do. I have to rewrite its story.</i><br><br>I brush my fingers through the air.<br>Words dance through the ruins of the virtual city.<br><br>The words become pictures, become sound, and begin<br>to weave together a tale. A tale about myself, a tale I want<br>to tell someone, leave with someone.<br><br>I write my story alone. But these are words I could never<br>have known if not for my solitude. Love from a parent to<br>their child—words Pod taught me. That is what I truly wanted<br>to write. I finally understand now.<br><br><i>All right. That should do it.</i><br><br>I don't know if it's a <i>good</i> story, but I think I've<br>written what I want to say.<br><br>Once I rewrite the story, the enemy freezes in place as<br>though bound. And then, it whispers in a sob:<br><br>"<i>I want to live.</i>"<br><br>The desire to live. That is everything I am—what Pod gave me<br>at the very end. And I, too, have passed it on to this child.<br><br>"Don't worry. You have a life of your own now."<br><br>The child falters and collapses. I take its hand. Though it<br>still looks like the enemy, there's an undeniable warmth in<br>its hand.<br><br>At last, a gentle light envelops it.<br>And from the light appears a girl.<br><br>The girl looks exactly like me, and she wears a white dress.<br><br>As I watch her clothes flutter, I think of Pod—of Mama.</p>

<p class="title">Chapter 4: Erase (No.04)</p>
<p class="para">Enormous babies destroyed the virtual world.<br>And so, I created a new world in its place.<br><br>But I was alone. No matter what I created, I was by myself.<br>So, I decided to write stories.<br><br>I wanted stories to be my friends, like how the weapon<br>memories soothed my loneliness on the moon base so long ago.<br><br>But it didn't really go all that well—what I created were<br>stories with no feeling behind them at all.<br><br>I guess that would explain why the main character of the<br>story manifested as a dark aberration and destroyed the<br>world I'd created.<br><br>But it's fine. I told the characters in the story what was<br>most important to me. I managed to incorporate the love Pod<br>gave me into the tales.<br><br>"I want to live," the dark foe whispered, then transformed<br>into a girl who looked just like me.<br><br><i>I want to live</i>.<br><br>Her wish is the same as mine.<br>That desire is passed down to the next generation,<br>like a child inheriting her mother's genes.<br><br>Maybe data... Maybe consciousness can continue existing<br>so long as it has the desire to keep living, just as my own<br>data found life again after destruction.<br><br>There's me, and there's the girl born from the story I<br>wrote. If I trace the lines of our existence back, we were<br>both brought to life by Pod's love. As we spend eternity<br>together, we begin to consider one another dear.<br><br>We eat breakfast together and play chess together in our<br>own dull little world. We chat as I write new stories, and we<br>snuggle under the blankets at night.<br><br>She grows rather belligerent at some point. All she does<br>is complain and fling insults. She tells me she's sick of<br>coffee and toast. She asks me if there's any point in<br>playing chess.<br><br>And I can't help but meddle in turn. I always end up<br>lecturing her when I don't need to, and so our arguments<br>are endless.<br><br>But it's when she reads my stories that her eyes sparkle,<br>and she truly seems happy.<br><br>Fairy tales of worlds ruled by dragons and magic.<br>Spooky little horror stories.<br>Tales of boys who cross the galaxy.<br>She loves them all.<br><br>One day, I sense a change in my world.<br>Someone is trying to gouge a hole in it.<br><br>I made this world. I won't let abnormalities slip me by.<br>I immediately make my way to where I sense it happening.<br><br>There, at the far end of the world, where it meets<br>nothingness, I find the girl. She deceived me and is<br>attempting to leave this world.<br><br>"Don't do this," I say to her. "It's dangerous out there."<br><br>I urge her to stop. Those enormous babies might still be out<br>there. Enemies I've never known might be out there.<br><br>I want to leave too.<br>I want nothing more than to go back to Mama.<br><br>But I don't want her to get hurt. This is a safe world, one<br>where she'll never know pain. I want her to grow up happy.<br><br>So, at least for now, we have to stay here together.<br><br>She disagrees.<br><br>"I want freedom. I want to live by my own will, like the<br>characters in the stories you read me," she says.<br><br>Well...I guess this was inevitable. I have to acknowledge my<br>defeat. Frankly, I expected to find her here, and I had a<br>hunch about her objectives.<br><br>She's like me, after all.<br>And right now, I'm like how Pod once was.<br><br>Long ago, I had been trapped in a small, boring world,<br>and I couldn't help but seek the truth.<br>Pod was the one who tried to stop me.<br><br>It was Pod who lost back then. I can't stop the will of one<br>who acts on her convictions. I simply can't.<br><br>And I'm familiar with the sadness born of someone precious<br>betraying your feelings. So I know full well...I can't do<br>any more to stop her.<br><br>"You're...coming with me, right?"<br><br>She takes my hand. I nod, and we step outside the world—<br>into the vast, digital void.<br><br>I look back to see the world I created sitting clearly<br>within the darkness.<br><br>As we move farther and farther away, the memories of the<br>tales I created and the recollection of the time I spent<br>with the girl blur, melting into the darkness.<br><br>"It's so far away now..." she murmurs.<br>There's a faint sadness in her expression.<br><br>Suddenly, noise rips through her body.<br>A drop of static rolls down her cheek like a tear.<br><br>"Huh...?"<br><br>Before I realize it, the static envelops her. At the same<br>time, I begin to see the world I created falling apart in<br>the distance.<br><br>Dark static swallows it—my bright, gleaming star.<br><br>As I watch, a memory comes to me—one of parting,<br>when I watched the eclipse after seeing off my friends<br>from The Cage.<br><br>"Why!?"<br><br>The static grows louder, bolder.<br>But...I think I know what's happening.<br><br>I think the farther I get from the world I created, from the<br>origin point, my creations cannot hold their form. I had a<br>feeling this might happen, but I'd decided not to think<br>about it.<br><br>Long ago, when the girl was born as a dark aberration,<br>I escaped her rampage by leaving the world.<br>I watched as it broke apart in destruction.<br><br>I assumed that was because she had lost control, but I was<br>wrong—it was because I'd attempted to leave that world. My<br>own creation broke apart. This world, these stories, are a<br>mirror that replicated me.<br><br>If I'm gone from that space, then everything I've created—<br>the town, the library, the books—will fall apart. And that<br>means...at this rate, I will lose the friend whose hand I<br>hold now too.<br><br><i>It's a bummer, but...I guess I just have to be ready<br>for the inevitable.</i><br><br>I let go of her hand. I cut my connection to the world I've<br>been chasing this whole time.<br><br>"I entrust everything to you," I say.<br><br>I fill the bewildered girl with copies of my consciousness<br>data—all of my memories of the life I led as 10H are hers now.<br><br>Her white dress stains black, and she becomes an exact copy<br>of me. As she fades into the distance, she desperately<br>reaches for my hand.<br><br>"It's okay!<br>I haven't let go of the memories we shared together!"<br><br>I wave, and I call to her vanishing form once more.<br><br>"Goodbye!"<br><br>To be honest, I don't even feel like shouting so loudly and<br>energetically. But I'd feel bad for her if I made this<br>parting any sadder than it already is.<br><br>"...I'll find you again."<br><br>But I think she understands how I feel.<br>She doesn't reach out to me anymore.<br><br>"If you find Mama, tell her I said hi!"<br><br>"Okay! I will."<br><br>"You were my best..."<br><br>"......"<br><br>Her form shrinks into the distance.<br><br>"...I had so much fun, you know."<br><br>And then, my lone friend sets off on a journey to a place<br>far, far away.<br><br><br>48414e44204845415254<br>20484552204d592d4245<br>53542e2e2e20484f5045<br><br><br>Endless silence. Eternal hours of solitude.<br><br>After seeing off the one friend I created with my own hands,<br>I returned to my lonely world once more.<br><br>Now, I have the power to create everything. I have a god-<br>like power, the sort humans once worshiped, to breathe life<br>into the characters of the stories I create.<br><br>But I never make myself a new friend.<br>There's nothing else I need to create.<br><br>I have given all of my most cherished things to my friend,<br>who ventured off into the far distance. Because for her,<br>this world—her beginning—is my end.<br><br>All that's left in me is loneliness and my adoration for my<br>friend.<br><br>I live on alone for her sake alone. And strangely, I do not<br>feel loneliness.<br><br>Because I know that the girl who has set off, carrying my<br>hopes and dreams, will eventually meet all sorts of people.<br><br><br>Snow falls in the virtual sky.<br>The ruined city is blanketed in white.<br><br>The sky splits, the seas dry, and cities become mountains<br>of rubble. My creations shattered when we left this world<br>together. It's probably about time to fix it up, but...<br>I want to keep things like this for just a little longer.<br><br>I know it's a bit sentimental, but I want to maintain the<br>place where we were together for as long as I can.<br><br>In the gaps of snow-covered rubble, I sit down on a chair<br>in front of a white cart and begin my breakfast.<br><br>I put way too much butter on my toast. I pour myself a<br>coffee more reminiscent of a sickly sweet sludge.<br><br>And then, I look at the empty seat opposite me.<br><br>My breakfast is quiet, boring, and solitary.<br>But it's always during these moments that I feel<br>I'm crossing paths with those two.<br><br>I always hear their voices nagging in my head—a friend who<br>laughs, "You always use too much butter;" Mama who scolds,<br>"Excessive sugar is poison for the body."<br><br>Well...today, I live on, as I've done in the days before.<br>To keep the flame of love, given to me by Mama and my<br>friend, burning bright.</p>

<p class="para">10H... Unlike the others, you weren't originally meant to<br>leave any records behind. You're an android, after all.<br>You're not what we're meant to be reviving—you're not human.<br>But you are, without a doubt in my mind, a dear child of mine.<br><br>Neither your chassis nor mine will return to Earth, like<br>human bodies do. Together, we've done all we can to protect<br>the planet for the sake of humanity. But unfortunately,<br>Earth will never take us into her.<br><br>But, you see, it's because we will never reconcile that we<br>had our own home on the moon—the lunar base. The celestial<br>body closest to heaven, one that will never meet with Earth,<br>one that floats ephemeral like foam. Proof that we both<br>existed will be forever etched onto the moon.<br><br>We fought daily, and you seldom listened to what I had to<br>say, but...you were truly so sensitive and thoughtful. You<br>were smarter than anyone else I'd ever known, and deep down,<br>you were very kind. When I die one day, I will be your grave<br>marker and leave everything here.<br><br>----------<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>"We're finally done collecting everything..."<br><br>"This is the last of the evaluation records of the people<br>in The Cage that the Mamas made."<br><br>And it is likely the last of the hidden stories.<br><br>Hidden Stories... They first came about a few years ago,<br>didn't they? Data that should have been stored in The Cage<br>had been quietly locked and altered to be inaccessible even<br>to the Mamas.<br><br>So that's why I've been busy running around The Cage,<br>undoing the shell-like locks, and spending a great deal of<br>time restoring a mountain of data. Frankly, I didn't think<br>there would be so many... I'm exhausted.<br><br>But I have a few reasons for working so hard on their<br>restoration. Publishing and re-reading hidden stories<br>is nice, of course. But if those were the only reasons,<br>I wouldn't have lasted as long as I did.<br><br><br>To be honest, the reason Mama's been able to work so hard<br>for so long is because of who locked all this data in the<br>first place.<br><br>I always got an inkling when I undid these locks, the<br>faintest fragrance of a girl I spent many long years and<br>months with.<br><br>That's right. All those hidden stories? I'm pretty sure it<br>was 10H's little prank. But before I could get proof and<br>make her confess, she was already gone... So...<br><br>So, it was a lot of fun. We know she's gone, of course.<br>But whenever we righted the little pranks she left behind,<br>it always felt like she was nearby. I swear I could hear that<br>carefree laugh of hers.<br><br>But this, too, is over. We've rectified her final prank now,<br>and...I can't let my memories of her hold me back forever.<br><br>I think it's about time I lock this all away in my heart as<br>quiet memories.<br><br>10H... It was so much fun right up to the end.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Hmm?"<br><br>But hold on a moment. This record would have been left<br>behind <i>after</i> we lost 10H.<br><br>Then...who was responsible for this? Not to mention, the<br>actual volume of this data is a bit higher than the typical<br>estimate.<br><br>Didn't this happen before? There was once a packet of data<br>that held an unusually high volume. Hmm... Which one was<br>that, again? If only I could remember where that was, I<br>could analyze this...</p>
