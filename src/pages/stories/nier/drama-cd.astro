<p class="title"><b>Project
Gestalt: Informational Release #01035.</b></p>
<p class="para">In 2003, a massive unknown
object—commonly referred to as “Giant”—appeared above the
Shinjuku district of Tokyo, bringing about the 6/12 incident. Our
opinions on the incident and the circumstances of ensuing events
originating from it will be outlined here.</p>
<p class="para">Regarding June 12th’s “Giant”
that appeared above Shinjuku: Although this resulted in enormous
financial losses, and despite the wide-scale panic that followed, the
number of physical injuries was minimal. However, after considering
all possible origins of the various events which occurred following
this, we determined it was appropriate to report it as the
instigating factor in our initial Project Gestalt reports.</p>
<p class="para">December 2003, half a year after
the fall of both the red dragon and “Giant”, outbreaks began of a
rare disease in which the whole body undergoes a change in color
before death. Christened “White Chlorination Syndrome”, the
number of infected persons and areas affected by the disease
continued to rapidly spread.</p>
<p class="para">The remains of the red dragon,
believed to be one of the causes of this disease, were reportedly
collected by the Japanese government. But in the effort to leave
nothing out of this release, it is noted that the current whereabouts
of these remains are unknown.</p>
<p class="para">Now, our current issue at hand is
the number of formal objections that have been made by the World
Purification Committee. In the past several months, it’s been
confirmed that a growing number of Tokyo residents infected with WCS
have been surviving... Rather than dying, these individuals fall into
a violent rage, becoming the early form of beings called&nbsp;
“Legion.” The ensuing battle with Legion would last for upwards
of 30 years, having become the single greatest threat to humanity
across the globe. ​</p>

victory for humanity was in clear sight. However, outbreaks of White
Chlorination Syndrome remained unabated, and the population continued
to dwindle.</p>
<p class="para">In turn, the Hamelin Organization,
part of the fight against Legion since 2014, released a number of
deeply intriguing reports. The results of their research on a sample
extracted from the “Giant” indicated that even if total
eradication of White Chlorination Syndrome was not possible, a way to
avoid contagion had been found.</p>
<p class="para">This method, referred to as
“Gestaltization”, involved the separation of a person’s soul
from their physical body. The process was not without faults, but as
no other methods for combating the disease had become
available, plans were announced for people across the globe to be
made into Gestalts in 2030. ​</span></p>

<p class="title">Project
Gestalt Implementation Progress Provisional Report</p>
<p class="title">Progress on the Research and
Development of the Replicant System:</p>
<p class="para">Designed for use in Project
Gestalt, the development of the Replicant system is approaching
completion. Additionally, the error rate in decoding information from
the Gestalt form to Replicant body is being controlled at under 1%,
with Replicant consciousnesses confirmed destroyed and suppressed.</p>
<p class="para">As such, we Observers have been
dispatched in order to maintain humanities’ Replicant forms, to
ensure the possibility of their continued existence.</p>
<p class="title">“Relapse” Cases and the Original
Gestalt</p>
<p class="para">The Replicant system requires data
from the original human to be input into it, and in short: studying
only the resulting Gestalt is showing to be a futile endeavor. After
a certain amount of time has passed in Gestalts, there is an over 70%
likelihood that restoration as a human becomes impossible, compounded
by a failure of the reintegration process with Replicants. These
Gestalts—which have lost their original personalities—are known
as “relapse” cases, becoming in some ways beings akin to Legion.</p>
<p class="para">According to the newest research
from the World Purification Commission, if DNA resistant to relapse
exists, then from that a template for stemming the occurrence of
relapses could be created. The Gestalt with this DNA was referred to
as the “Original Gestalt”. A large portion of the UN’s budget
was focused on locating the Original, yet progress remained stagnant.
To keep on the planned schedule, the general population was
transitioned into Phase Two.</p>
<p class="title">The Original Replicant</p>
<p class="para">To find a candidate suitable for
impression onto a Replicant, the UN and a number of other nations
pressed forward to Phase Two. In hopes of hastening the search, this
stage forewent the use of only interested applicants, in favor of
making Gestaltization compulsory or by switching to mass recruitment
strategies. Within Japan, Phase Two was implemented silently,
selecting potential candidates from members of the general public
with few or no living blood relatives. From those chosen, final
determinations were made by way of a selection exam, the contents of
which are part of a separate report. Relevant to this report,
selection committee members were pulled from the Ministries of
Defense, Health, Labor, Welfare and the Cabinet, as well as temporary
appointments from the World Purification Commission to act as aides
in progression and completion.</p>

as classified and forbidden from being disseminated outside of the

<p class="title">The Rogue Red Eye Incident</p>
<p class="para">According to a later investigation,
the recent incident with Red Eye has been confirmed as being related
to the conspiracy between the National Weapons Research Lab and a
portion of the JSDF’s vie for power. What was unknown until the
incident, however, is that staff members had also been bribed with
large sums of money and goods. Much of the funds were received from
the Kaali estate in the form of donations, but taking into account
her standing as a National Hero, the Internal Investigations Bureau
has decided it will not question her actions. In addition to this,
Masayoshi Yura’s whereabouts following the incident are unknown.
Yura, the previous acting chief of the JSDF’s Division for
Countermeasures against Anomalous Biological Organisms and commander
of the Shinjuku Defense Corps, remains at large.</p>
<h3 class="western" align="center"><a name="the-girl-who-overthrew-red-eye"></a>
<p class="title"><em>The Girl who Overthrew Red Eye</p>
<p class="para">According to eyewitness testimony
of JDSF forces and the ruined remains of Red Eye, we reason that her
abilities allow for augmenting the physical capabilities of the human
body to an extreme degree. Leaving aside reports of her ability to
jump over 20 meters and the destruction of Red Eye’s outer shell,
an investigation deeper into the actual circumstances of the event
was considered. However, as a matter of national security, it was
decided that the Japanese Internal Investigations Bureau will be
handling all further research. Hereafter, any details pertaining to
the girl are unknown.</p>
<p class="para">The National Weapons Research Lab
and the Weapon No.7: One of the responsible parties of this recent
Red Eye incident, the chief of research at the National Weapons
Research Lab, is confirmed dead. To prevent a second, similar act of
terrorism from occurring, per discussions between the World
Purification Commission and Japanese Government, it’s been decided
that personnel from the Commission shall be placed within and monitor
the Internal Investigations Bureau indefinitely. As for the weapon
No.7, after pacification it was placed into suspended animation and
returned to the National Weapons Research Lab once more. Due to the
inherent risk of No.7 as a weapon, disposal was initially considered.
But because the originally intended method of destroying the No.6
weapon is yet unknown, No.7’s capabilities of sealing it were
judged to be indispensable, thus deferring its removal.</p>
<p class="title">Additional Notes: Regarding Male Trial
Subject A, the “Original Gestalt”</p>
<p class="para">Following these events, the subject
of this information and previous pending concerns, Male Subject A,
has been selected as the “Original Gestalt” per the success of
his pact in Project Grimoire Noir. At the same time, we have on
record that Male Subject A’s younger sister (designated Female
Subject B) has taken to the specialized stasis procedure. Male
Subject A, as part of an official government contract, was promised
that Female Subject B would be included in the Gestalt decryption
process. Unfortunately, due to damage to the data collected during
the Gestaltization, we have ascertained that later decryption from
Gestalt may be prone to failure. Considering Male Subject A’s vital
role and the length of time required of Project Gestalt, there is
potential for this information to become a large issue, and we
concluded that further observation of the subject was necessary. As a
result, releases of this information cannot be shared with Male
Subject A, but Observers will record it as refuted. That is all.</p>
