<p class="1"></p>
<p class="para">With wings aglow, a bird soared through the vast sky.</p>
<p class="para">Though a thin veil of cloud stretched across it, the sky was boundless—and beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that it was hard to believe the scene unfolding below belonged to the same world. The shouting, the blood spray—none of it reached this high. Not even the rising clouds of dust could touch this place.</p>
<p class="para">Before long, the bird began to circle lazily, as if mocking the humans below, then disappeared into the distance.</p>
<p class="para">"Infantry sighted ahead!"</p>
<p class="para">Down on the ground, no one noticed the bird in flight.
    <br>The only ones looking to the sky were the dead.
</p>
<p class="para">"Lord Caim, please be careful!"</p>
<p class="para">The voice that rang out belonged to a soldier long past the age for the battlefield. The one who answered him, in contrast, was a young man—still in the prime of youth.</p>
<p class="para">"Don’t falter—charge!"</p>
<p class="para">Yet despite his youth, his movements bore the mark of a seasoned warrior.
    <br>There was no hesitation in the path his blade carved.
    <br>He cut down foes without mercy, crushed them without pause.
    <br>Kicking aside fallen corpses, he pressed forward, sweeping through the enemies around him.
</p>
<p class="para">But no matter how many he cut down—no matter how many he left in his wake—the soldiers kept coming, spilling forth from nowhere, as if summoned by the battlefield itself.</p>
<p class="para">“Enemy reinforcements at the rear!”</p>
<p class="para">There was no time to listen. He focused solely on cutting down the enemy.</p>
<p class="para">“What strength… These things—these aren’t human!”</p>
<p class="para">Those red eyes were proof enough.
    <br>Whether they were born with such features or driven to this state by some sinister elixir, no one could say for sure.
</p>
<p class="para">A cry rose—half scream, half realization.
    <br>Yes, that’s right. They aren’t human.
    <br>They’re <i>ticks</i>. Imperial ticks.
</p>
<p class="para">And so, there was no place for guilt. No pang of conscience.
    <br>Even when he brought his blade down upon the skull of a trembling, retreating soldier, his hand didn’t waver.
</p>
<p class="para">Why is it that the blood and flesh of one’s enemies can feel so… gratifying?
    <br>The stench of blood that should be repulsive—the sensation of flesh splitting, of bone shattering—was nothing short of delightful.
    <br>For a moment, he almost forgot he was meant to be leading a battalion.
</p>
<p class="para">And yet, what was this endlessness?
    <br>He began to wonder if the very corpses he struck down weren’t simply rising to their feet again.
</p>
<p class="para">“The enemy’s breached the castle! At this rate, Lady Furiae—!”</p>
<p class="para">Then, from behind, something hit him with enormous force.
    <br>A jolt of numbness shot from his shoulder down his back.
    <br>Before he even realized he’d been cut, his sword was already in motion—
    <br>and with every last ounce of strength, he crushed the enemy soldier behind him.
</p>


<p class="para">Suddenly, the ground beneath his feet gave way.
    <br>He scrambled to steady himself—falling now would mean instant death.
</p>
<p class="para">His sword arm had gone strangely rigid.
    <br>There wasn’t much pain, but each breath came harder than the last.
    <br>He drew air through clenched teeth, bracing both feet.
    <br>He couldn’t allow himself to fall. Not here.
</p>
<p class="para">He lifted his head, just as he moved to raise his sword again—
    <br>and saw it.
    <br>The banner over the castle gate was engulfed in flames.
    <br>The enemy had set it alight.
</p>
<p class="para">The banner blazing.
    <br>Flaming arrows raining down.
    <br>Chaos.
    <br>Blood.
    <br>And then—
    <br>…his parents’ death.
</p>
<p class="para">“Furiae…”</p>
<p class="para">In that moment, the memory surged back to life—and strength flooded his limbs.
    <br>Caim took off, running without thinking.
</p>
<p class="para">Toward the goddess Furiae—
    <br>his sister.
    <br>The only family he had left in this world.
</p>
<p class="title">2</p>
<p class="para">When do people realize that they were no longer children, that the childhood that would seem like it would last forever was long gone?</p>
<p class="para">Caim thinks that he realized this too late. Being blessed with too much can spoil a person and sometimes hinder their growth. He was born into a royal family, and although the country was small, he grew up without want. His father, King Gaap, was a master of martial arts but also gentle, two qualities that were often contradictory in any other king, and was highly praised as a wise ruler.</p>
<p class="para">The kingdom was prosperous, and its relations with neighboring nations were peaceful.</p>
<p class="para">Had he known the loneliness so often tied to royal succession, things might have turned out differently.
    <br>But Caim had a friend—his name was Inuart.
</p>
<p class="para">Among all his vassals, King Gaap trusted none more than Inuart’s father, Ipris.
    <br>He named Ipris Prime Minister, and treated Inuart as if he were his own son.
</p>
<p class="para">Gaap himself had been raised by the previous king, a strict man who valued rank and lineage above all else.
    <br>As a result, Gaap grew to adulthood without knowing what true friendship was. Even after ascending the throne at a young age, it took time before he found anyone he could truly call a confidant.
</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps that was why he so deeply wished for his son, Caim, to have someone he could trust from an early age.
    <br>Even a king doesn’t want his child to suffer as he once did.
</p>
<p class="para">Whether by fate or the king’s intention, that wish came true—Caim and Inuart became the closest of friends.
    <br>They played together endlessly in the palace gardens, and now and then got into mischief, earning scoldings from the head maidservant. In time, Furiae was born, and their duo became a trio.
</p>
<p class="para">Once Furiae was old enough to run on her own, the three of them came up with a plan: they would sneak out of the palace.
    <br>They’d hide in the back of a merchant’s wagon—one of the regular traders who came and went.
</p>
<p class="para">As long as they kept quiet in the bed of the cart, they could slip past the guards at the rear gate and evade the patrols near the palace grounds.
    <br>Then, when the wagon slowed, they would leap off and dash away.
</p>
<p class="para">It worked.</p>
<p class="para">On the way back, they would return through the main gate, heads held high, asking the guards to open it as if they’d simply exited through another door.</p>
<p class="para">However, as their antics repeated, even the gatekeepers began to grow suspicious. Eventually, one of them reported the matter to the head maid, and the trio’s “unauthorized excursions” came to light. From that day on, all merchant wagons entering the palace had their cargo thoroughly inspected.</p>
<p class="para">On another occasion, the three came up with a new idea—digging a tunnel beneath the castle walls to sneak out. But no sooner had they started than a gardener caught them, and they were soundly scolded once again.</p>
<p class="para">Every time Inuart’s “misdeeds” came to light, his father, Ipris, would go pale and beg forgiveness. But King Gaap would simply laugh with an air of generosity.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s nothing to worry about. If they lack the cunning to slip past a guard’s notice, I’d be more concerned for their future.
    <br>More importantly, childhood friends are treasures for life. There’s no need to take it so seriously.”
</p>
<p class="para">After saying this, it was his habit to turn to the queen at his side for agreement.</p>
<p class="para">Caim’s mother had come from a neighboring kingdom to marry King Gaap. Accompanying her at that time had been the woman who now served as the head maid. It was said that Caim’s mother and the head maid had grown up together like sisters, their bond as close as family.</p>
<p class="para">In time, King Gaap began personally teaching Caim and Inuart the art of the sword. Thus, the two boys were not only playmates but rivals as well.</p>
<p class="para">King Gaap was one of the most accomplished swordsmen in the history of the royal line, and his son Caim, bearing that blood, showed remarkable talent—so much so that it astonished those around him. Inuart, too, improved quickly and became a skilled swordsman in his own right, but no matter how hard he tried, he could never best Caim. When Caim suggested it was simply the difference in their age, Inuart, frustrated by the truth of it, would throw himself even more fervently into their matches.</p>
<p class="para">Even so, nothing ever came between them. Their friendship remained strong.</p>
<p class="para">Still, if they kept sparring forever, Furiae—waiting for them to finish—would grow restless. Having been part of their lives since she could remember, Furiae didn’t take kindly to being left out while the boys trained.</p>
<p class="para">“This is boring! All you two ever do is practice with swords.”</p>
<p class="para">With her arms crossed and her cheeks puffed in a pout, it usually fell to Inuart to calm her down.</p>
<p class="para">That was because Inuart had a gift Caim did not—he could sing.
    <br>No matter how long she had waited, the moment Inuart strummed his harp and began to sing,
    <br>Furiae’s mood would soften immediately.
</p>
<p class="para">“Sing more.”</p>
<p class="para">Whatever sulking she’d been doing was forgotten in an instant as she asked for the next song.
    <br>And then another. And another after that.
    <br>Such was the power of Inuart’s voice—it captivated the heart and refused to let go.
</p>
<p class="para">It seemed he had inherited his musical talent from his mother’s side.
    <br>His maternal grandfather had been a celebrated harpist, and his late aunt—who died young—
    <br>had once been known as a songstress of the royal court.
</p>
<p class="para">Though it wasn’t only his music that charmed her, of course…
    <br>In time, Inuart and Furiae began to share the tender feelings of childhood love.
</p>
<p class="para">King Gaap welcomed the budding relationship between his daughter and the only son of his loyal vassal, Ipris. Though the wedding itself was still far off, they were not too young to be betrothed.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Inuart is a good match.</i></p>
<p class="para">That was Caim’s honest thought when he first learned of their engagement. The two knew each other well, and there was no reason to believe Inuart would ever bring unhappiness to Furiae.
    <br>Their parents approved, and everyone in the palace offered blessings and kind words.
    <br>The quiet ache Caim felt in the corner of his heart, he told himself, must have been nothing more than a pang of loneliness—the sorrow of three becoming two and one.
    <br>Perhaps, at last, he could understand what Furiae had felt as she waited alone during those long hours of sword training.
</p>
<p class="para">But never did he imagine that this engagement would cast a shadow over the bond the three of them had shared—one that had once seemed unbreakable.</p>
<p class="para">The change came gradually—something began to twist, to fray. And looking back on it now, it was all painfully simple.</p>
<p class="para">Inuart wanted to become two and one. Caim accepted that.</p>
<p class="para">But Furiae did not.</p>
<p class="para">That was all it was.</p>
<p class="para">Caim believed it perfectly natural that Inuart would want to have Furiae to himself. But Furiae was still a child.
    <br>She didn’t want things to change. She still wanted to be spoiled by both her brother and her childhood friend, just as she always had.
</p>
<p class="para">And when he thought about her age, Caim couldn’t help but feel… maybe that wasn’t so unreasonable after all.</p>
<p class="para">Unfortunately, Inuart lacked the maturity to accept Furiae’s childishness. He wasn’t a child, but he wasn’t quite an adult either.
    <br>That awkward age left him without the patience to bear with her.
    <br>Unable to have Furiae all to himself, Inuart turned his frustration on Caim.
    <br>And Caim, for his part, couldn't bring himself to calmly reason with his sister or forgive his friend’s misplaced accusations.
    <br>He wasn’t that much of an adult either.
</p>
<p class="para"><i>We have to grow up.</i>
<br><i>The days of carefree laughter and playful scuffles are over.</i></p>
<p class="para">By the time Caim realized that, the rift between him and Inuart had already grown too wide to mend.</p>
<p class="para">Their conversations turned stiff and unnatural. When they sparred, it always became hostile.
    <br>No matter what he did, it only seemed to make things worse.
    <br>…Where had it gone wrong? What mistake had he made?
</p>
<p class="para">Clashing blades with Inuart, Caim felt a rising storm of frustration and despair.
    <br>This was no longer practice. It was a real fight.
</p>
<p class="para">There was hatred in Inuart’s eyes—and Caim was certain his own eyes mirrored it.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Why?</i>
<br>Why have we come to hate each other so much?</p>
<p class="para">At this rate, he might actually kill Inuart.</p>
<p class="para">Caim knew his own skill with the sword was superior.
    <br>If he kept going like this…
    <br>A chilling sense of dread swept through him. It dulled his blade for the briefest moment. Created an opening.
</p>
<p class="para">Then he heard a sound—not the sharp ring of clashing steel, but something else entirely.</p>
<p class="para">Heat seared into his right shoulder.
    <br>The pain hit a moment later.
    <br>He dropped to his knees without meaning to.
</p>
<p class="para">“Caim…”</p>
<p class="para">The bloodstained sword slipped from Inuart’s hand.
    <br>The soldiers standing by rushed forward in a panic.
</p>
<p class="para">“I’m fine… don’t worry,”
    <br>Caim managed to say—just barely.
</p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t a serious wound.
    <br>The royal physician judged that it wouldn’t take long to heal, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
    <br>Given the circumstances, Caim insisted it was an accident—that he’d been distracted during sparring with live blades—and King Gaap accepted his explanation without question. He never once considered punishing Inuart.
</p>
<p class="para">But there were two people who couldn’t forgive him.</p>
<p class="para">One was Ipris.
    <br>Even if it had been an accident, he argued, Inuart still had to take responsibility.
    <br>He ordered his son to remain confined under house arrest for the time being.
    <br>As a loyal subject, Ipris could not overlook what had happened.
</p>
<p class="para">The other was Furiae.</p>
<p class="para">Overwhelmed with worry for her brother, she had lashed out at Inuart with bitter accusations.
    <br>Caim hadn’t been there to see it, but the moment he saw his sister’s face the next morning, he knew exactly what had happened.
</p>
<p class="para">“What did you say to Inuart?”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing,” Furiae replied, not meeting Caim’s eyes.</p>
<p class="para">And that was all the confirmation he needed.</p>
<p class="para">“It wasn’t Inuart’s fault. It was an accident.”</p>
<p class="para">“But…”</p>
<p class="para">“Make up with him.”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae lowered her head.</p>
<p class="para">“You know you went too far, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s not true. Inuart was the one at fault. Because…”</p>
<p class="para">“Because?”</p>
<p class="para">“Because today is your birthday, Caim-nii-sama! It’s awful… for something like this to happen today…”</p>
<p class="para">Caim let out a wry laugh.
    <br>He couldn’t help but find his sister amusing—dragging up something completely unrelated just so she wouldn’t have to admit she’d gone too far.
</p>
<p class="para">“So it would’ve been fine if it weren’t my birthday?”</p>
<p class="para">He teased her gently, and Furiae fell silent.
    <br>But she quickly found something else to say, and opened her mouth again.
</p>
<p class="para">“But because of your injury, the celebration got canceled!”</p>
<p class="para">Caim’s eighteenth birthday had been declared a national holiday.
    <br>A grand feast was supposed to be held at the royal palace.
    <br>But out of concern for his son, King Gaap had abruptly called it off.
</p>
<p class="para">Instead, King Gaap had granted the vassals and soldiers a day of rest.</p>
<p class="para">“Then I guess we should be thanking Inuart,” Caim said. “I was never too fond of banquets anyway.”</p>
<p class="para">As he gently teased his sister, he realized the tightness in his chest had finally begun to ease.
    <br>It was strange—almost like something had been exorcised.
    <br>For the first time in what felt like ages, he thought they might be able to laugh together again, like they used to.
    <br>Inuart might not be ready to reconcile just yet, but Caim felt he could wait patiently.
</p>
<p class="para">Now that he thought about it, he hadn’t felt this calm in a long time.
    <br>Ever since the engagement between Inuart and Furiae, something inside him had always felt jagged, raw.
    <br>But now, it was gone—completely, without a trace.
    <br>Maybe he was finally ready to grow up.
    <br>And if that was the case, then it wasn’t such a bad birthday after all.
</p>
<p class="para">Sunlight streamed gently through the windows, and a peaceful stillness hung over the palace.
    <br>Caim silently offered his gratitude to his father, the king, for giving him such a restful day.
</p>
<p class="para">But only a few hours later, everything changed.</p>
<p class="para">While Caim and his family were enjoying a quiet moment together in the palace courtyard…
    <br>The Reaper cloaked in pitch-black descended from the sky.
</p>
<p class="para">The Black Dragon.</p>
<p class="para">Not just Caim and Furiae, but likely even their parents—this was probably the first time any of them had ever seen one with their own eyes.
    <br>Dragons were said to be divine messengers, rarely appearing before humans.
</p>
<p class="para">Which is why, when that black-winged creature came gliding down from the sky…
    <br>None of them were prepared.
</p>
<p class="para">After all, the idea that a divine messenger would attack unarmed humans was beyond imagining.</p>
<p class="para">It all happened in an instant.
    <br>A black whirlwind swept through them.
    <br>Time stood still.
</p>
<p class="para">In the next moment, Caim saw red flash across his wide-open eyes.
    <br>The dragon tore his mother apart with its claws, then lunged at his father with its razor-sharp fangs.
    <br>He heard himself screaming.
</p>
<p class="para">The dragon turned to look at him—its eyes blazed with a brilliant, hellish red.</p>
<p class="para">That was the last thing Caim remembered.</p>
<p class="para">When he came to, the Black Dragon had already vanished into the sky.</p>
<p class="para">Furiae stood beside him, pale and shaking. Pain seared through his right shoulder.
    <br>He couldn’t remember what he’d done, only that his wound was bleeding freely.
</p>
<p class="para">Drops of blood trickled down his fingers.
    <br>Forgetting even to press against the wound, Caim walked toward the bodies of his father and mother.
    <br>He knelt beside them. Held them.
</p>
<p class="para">They no longer breathed.
    <br>Their eyes were still open in shock.
    <br>He gently reached out to close their lids.
</p>
<p class="para">He couldn’t bring himself to rage or weep.
    <br>He simply stared at their corpses.
</p>
<p class="para">After King Gaap's death, the kingdom fell into ruin with shocking speed.</p>
<p class="para">Though the land was fertile, the country had always been small.
    <br>Its peaceful relations with neighboring states had been entirely thanks to the king’s personal diplomacy.
</p>
<p class="para">In every sense of the word, Gaap had been the linchpin of the realm.</p>
<p class="para">The prime minister, Ipris, took over the reins of government, but he could not take the king’s place.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps things might have gone differently if Caim had ascended the throne as the new king once the mourning period ended.</p>
<p class="para">Loyal retainers still remained at court, and though Caim was young, the people pinned their hopes on the prince who carried King Gaap’s blood.</p>
<p class="para">But Caim did not take up that role.
    <br>He <i>couldn’t.</i>
</p>
<p class="para">If only the celebration had gone ahead as planned that day.
    <br>If only they hadn’t gone out into the courtyard.
</p>
<p class="para">It had been his own fault they’d ended up outside, without even a guard posted.
    <br>The Black Dragon may have killed his parents, but wasn’t he complicit in that tragedy?
</p>
<p class="para">With such thoughts in his heart, how could he possibly take up his father’s crown?</p>
<p class="para">And that wasn’t all.</p>
<p class="para">After King Gaap's death, the royal court became awash with wild rumors.
    <br>Some claimed the Black Dragon had been sent by a fanatical cult.
    <br>Others said it was divine punishment from the goddess of the seal, Asherah, who had harbored a forbidden love for Gaap.
    <br>Still others whispered that it was Prime Minister Ipris who summoned the monster through some sinister rite, as part of a treasonous plot.
</p>
<p class="para">No matter how hard Caim tried to shut them out, the rumors always reached his ears.
    <br>What stung the most were those claiming that Ipris had incited his son Inuart to wound Caim.
    <br>They said Ipris had orchestrated the cancellation of the banquet and kept the palace free of soldiers, all part of his scheme.
</p>
<p class="para">And there was more still.
    <br>Back when Gaap had been a prince, it was said he and Ipris had been bitter enemies.
    <br>Despite the prime minister’s outward show of loyalty, perhaps he had been biding his time all along, waiting for the chance to bring Gaap down.
</p>
<p class="para">There were even those who whispered, saying that Ipris had been waiting for his chance all along.</p>
<p class="para">Most of it was, in all likelihood, nothing more than groundless rumor.
    <br>But to those who do not know the truth, every rumor has a ring of plausibility to it.
    <br>And it is said that no matter how steeped in falsehood, a rumor always contains at least a sliver of truth.
    <br>Some even say that rumors are the desires of the people themselves.
</p>
<p class="para">That Ipris was a traitor was a claim hard to believe on its face.</p>
<p class="para">Yet it was true that he would have known the palace guard was thin that day—
    <br>and that Caim and his family were passing the afternoon in the courtyard.
    <br>That precisely timed assault…
    <br>If the rumors were true—
</p>
<p class="para">Unable to bear the growing weight of doubt day after day,
    <br>Caim went to Ipris and asked him directly:
    <br>Was it true that he had once been an enemy of his father?
</p>
<p class="para">Caim had expected him to deny it without hesitation.
    <br>But Ipris answered otherwise.
</p>
<p class="para">“It is true. But I knelt before the king and swore loyalty and obedience.
    <br>It is precisely because one is an enemy… that a bond can be born.”
</p>
<p class="para">Caim could not take those words at face value.
    <br>Rather, he resented Ipris for not denying it—even if it had only been a lie.
</p>
<p class="para">Caim resented Ipris.
    <br>And he came to loathe the retainers who brought him these troubling rumors.
    <br>He could no longer bring himself to trust anyone.
</p>
<p class="para">Caim avoided facing Inuart as much as he could.
    <br>If he opened his mouth, he would surely say something that could never be taken back.
    <br>More than anything, he feared that if he truly faced Inuart, he would come to hate him in earnest.
</p>
<p class="para">After all, it was Inuart who had wounded him to begin with.</p>
<p class="para">Just before the tragedy, Caim had thought the bitterness he felt toward Inuart had finally begun to fade.
    <br>He had started to believe that one day, they might again laugh together as they once had, and speak to one another as they used to.
    <br>He had resolved to wait patiently for that day to come.
    <br>But now—what had that even been?
    <br>Looking back, all that filled him was emptiness.</p>
<p class="para">It was then, as if to mock his hopes, that civil war broke out.
    <br>One faction sought to install Caim as the new king,
    <br>while another desired that Prime Minister Ipris continue his rule.
    <br>The conflict escalated into armed violence.
    <br>Yet Caim himself had no part in it—he hadn’t even been aware it was happening.
</p>
<p class="para">The rebellion grew with each passing day,
    <br>and eventually, even the royal palace was touched by the flames of war.
    <br>At last, Ipris called upon a neighboring king to send reinforcements.
    <br>The uprising was suppressed,
    <br>but with it, the nation itself began to crumble in earnest.
</p>
<p class="para">That was when Caim made up his mind to leave the palace.</p>
<p class="para">His very existence—regardless of his own will—was being used as justification for war.
    <br>That was something he could never accept.
    <br>If he remained in the palace, the same thing would surely happen again…
</p>
<p class="para">And so, one morning, Caim departed without a word.
    <br>He told no one—not even Inuart, not even the retainers.
    <br>It had been nearly a full year since the day his parents were killed.
</p>
<p class="para">He had intended to leave alone.
    <br>He had no destination in mind, no path laid before him.
    <br>He needed no companion.
</p>
<p class="para">The only one he confided in was Furiae—
    <br>and that was only because he believed it would be the final farewell of this life.
</p>
<p class="para">“Go home. You’re in the way.”</p>
<p class="para">No matter how harshly he turned her away, Furiae only shook her head, firm and unmoving.</p>
<p class="para">“Inuart is worried about you.”</p>
<p class="para">“He doesn’t have to be. I told him I was coming.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s not just about whether you told him or not.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae lowered her gaze.</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t stay by his side…Not when I feel like this.”</p>
<p class="para">Caim realized then: it wasn’t just him. She too had been tormented by the countless rumors—truths and lies twisted together. </p>
<p class="para">He sighed and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="para">“Do as you like.”</p>
<p class="para">The sky was a clear, piercing blue. Winter was close now.
    <br>But when he cast his eyes back to the ground, all he saw was scorched earth stretching on and on.
    <br>A line of people trudged past, heads bowed beneath the weight of small bundles strapped to their backs.
    <br>No one spoke a word. The silence was so deep, so oppressive, it chilled the blood.
    <br>It looked, Caim thought, like a funeral procession.
</p>
<p class="para">It was the first time he had truly seen the devastation with his own eyes.
    <br>The palace had taken damage during the civil war, but it hadn’t been left uninhabitable.
    <br>So even though he’d known in his mind that the country was falling apart,
    <br>he had never really felt it until now.
</p>
<p class="para">“What the hell have I been doing…”</p>
<p class="para">After his father’s death, he had thrown aside the burden he should have taken up.
    <br>And now this ruin stood before him as the consequence.
    <br>Even if he had been in shock, even if he hadn’t known what to do—there must have been some other way.
</p>
<p class="para">“…Too late now.”</p>
<p class="para">Caim muttered with a bitter laugh.
    <br>What’s done is done. No matter how deeply he regretted it,
    <br>the fields wouldn’t unburn.
    <br>The people who had lost their homes couldn’t return to their old lives.
</p>
<p class="para">“Hey, Nii-sama”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae suddenly stopped walking.</p>
<p class="para">“Let’s stop being royalty—starting today.”</p>
<p class="para">Now she says that…</p>
<p class="para">“As long as we’re royal, people will keep trying to use us, to kill us.
    <br>It’s because Father and Mother were king and queen that they were killed.
    <br>But we—my brother and I—we survived.”
</p>
<p class="para">That’s why, Furiae said, with a small smile,</p>
<p class="para">“Let’s just live as normal people. I never want to go through something like that again…”</p>
<p class="para">Wandering in a foreign land, lineage means nothing.
    <br>There’s no need to declare you’re living as a commoner—
    <br>and yet, by saying it out loud, Furiae was perhaps trying to ease the fear of leaving behind a life of comfort.
</p>
<p class="para">“Hey… it’s a good idea, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="para">When their parents had been attacked, he hadn’t been able to do a thing. He couldn’t protect the country, couldn’t protect the people. So at the very least—from this day forward—he would protect his sister, Furiae. The only family he had left.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother (Caim-nii-sama). No…Caim (Nii-san).”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae gave a bashful smile. And in that moment, Caim prayed from the bottom of his heart that her smile would never fade again.</p>
<p class="para">They were nearing the border when they saw it:
    <br>a black flag fluttering over the worship site.
    <br>Beneath the overcast sky, the sight gave off a quiet, foreboding weight.
    <br>It was likely that every shrine and temple, in every land, now flew the same black banner.
</p>
<p class="para">“The Goddess, Asherah, is dead.”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae’s voice was heavy.
    <br>Perhaps she was recalling the rumor that the goddess Asherah had once loved King Gaap.
</p>
<p class="para">“The Goddess of the Seal… Hmph. Maybe the world never really needed something like that to begin with.”</p>
<p class="para">In this world, what binds the Great Time—the source of order—to its rightful place
are the three seals held in the temples of forest, desert, and sea.
<br>And the goddess’s life itself.</p>
<p class="para">Once all the seals within the temples were undone, and the goddess’s life was lost, the “Great Time” would be unmoored from its rightful place, plunging the world into chaos. And when all living things stood on the brink of annihilation, it was said that the hand of god would give birth to an egg of rebirth (seeds of resurrection), bringing new order to the world once more.</p>
<p class="para">If the world was just going to be reborn by divine will anyway, then what was the point of the seals to begin with? That was how Caim saw it.</p>
<p class="para">
The goddess of the seal—said to exist only once in any given era—had originally been just a normal person. A woman living an ordinary life, suddenly declared a goddess, and imprisoned deep within a temple. From that moment on, she was cut off entirely from the world. She could never again see her family, her lover, or anyone she’d once known.
<br>For the woman forced into that role—and for those around her—what greater tragedy could there be?
<br>If the seals had never existed in the first place… then neither would such tragedies.</p>
<p class="para">“You mustn’t say things like that.”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae looked around, flustered. She probably didn’t want him speaking so irreverently in front of the people paying their respects at the shrine.</p>
<p class="para">“The gods want us humans to protect the world with our own hands. That’s what Mother—no, what Mom always used to say.”</p>
<p class="para">“Count me out. What’s the point, if it’s all just going to be reborn anyway?”</p>
<p class="para">“Brother!”</p>
<p class="para">“Now if <i>you</i> ever got chosen as the next goddess or whatever, I’d grab you and run before they could lay a finger on you. I mean—what’s the point in suffering through all that, when the egg of rebirth’s just gonna hatch (the seeds of resurrection will be sown) if we wait it out anyway?”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae shot him a glare. Caim shrugged exaggeratedly in response.</p>
<p class="para">There’d never been a story of a goddess candidate escaping her fate.
    <br>Were they really all so dull-witted that the thought never even crossed their minds?
    <br>Or perhaps—any such attempts had simply been buried in secrecy.
</p>
<p class="para">“Well, either way, it’s got nothing to do with us.”</p>
<p class="para">The sky began to darken all of a sudden. Rain was probably coming. Wanting to get inside before it hit, the two hurried toward the inn.</p>
<p class="para">The disturbance came sometime after midnight.
    <br>He thought he heard Furiae scream.
</p>
<p class="para">Caim jolted upright in the dark.
    <br>He reached blindly for the candlestick—
    <br>No. He didn’t need a light.
    <br>There was already a pale glow spilling from the corner of the room.
</p>
<p class="para">Caim froze where he stood.</p>
<p class="para">Furiae was lying on the floor.
    <br>Her body was wrapped in a spiral of white light.
</p>
<p class="para">“Furiae!”</p>
<p class="para">He rushed to her and lifted her into his arms. Her body radiated a strange heat.
    <br>Her forehead and hands were ice cold—yet the glowing part of her form was burning hot to the touch.
</p>
<p class="para">“It… hurts… Brother…”</p>
<p class="para">Furiae’s face twisted in pain. Sweat streamed down her cold forehead. The image from earlier that day flashed through Caim’s mind—the black flag raised over the sanctuary. He’d heard before: when a new candidate is chosen, a spiral-shaped script appears on the goddess’s body to mark her. This spiral-shaped light—could it be?</p>
<p class="para">No. This is an illness.</p>
<p class="para">He laid Furiae’s body gently on the bed, then burst out of the room. The innkeeper, startled by the commotion, was already getting up.</p>
<p class="para">“Get a healer! She’s sick!”</p>
<p class="para">But the one who came was not a healer—it was a priest from the sanctuary. The innkeeper, who had opened the shutters to summon help, froze in place. Slowly, with a look of pity, he turned to face Caim.</p>
<p class="para">A black flag raised. A priest arriving. No one could mistake what that meant.</p>
<p class="para">“By order of the High Priest, I’ve come to escort her.”</p>
<p class="para">Why so quickly? How did they know she was here?</p>
<p class="para">“The goddess is here, is she not?”</p>
<p class="para">The priest was young, and spoke in a calm, measured voice.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re wrong. She’s just sick. Now go—leave us!”</p>
<p class="para">Caim rushed back into the room and bolted the door from the inside. His hands were shaking—so hard, he could see it clearly.</p>
<p class="para">“Furiae…”</p>
<p class="para">There was no response. Perhaps even groaning had become too painful—Furiae lay still, her eyes closed, limp and motionless. No… no, this can’t be happening… Unable to bear it, Caim buried his face in his hands. Every single word he had spoken earlier that day now pierced through him like sharpened arrows.</p>
<p class="para">A knock sounded from behind. “Please open the door,” came the priest’s voice.</p>
<p class="para">“Go away!”</p>
<p class="para">He shouted toward the door. He wouldn’t give her up. The sealed goddess wasn’t merely forbidden from contact with the world of man—he had heard that the pain brought by the sealing power would torment her constantly… and that she wouldn’t live long.</p>
<p class="para">Even if the world were to collapse, he could never let his sister shoulder such a cruel fate.</p>
<p class="para">Yes… he just had to do what he’d said earlier. He’d run. Take Furiae and flee.</p>
<p class="para">“If we do nothing, her life is in danger.”</p>
<p class="para">Caim lifted his head. What was that supposed to mean?</p>
<p class="para">“The rite of transference isn’t complete. Unless the High Priest intervenes directly, the seal cannot be finalized. An incomplete seal… will consume the goddess’s life.”</p>
<p class="para">His hand, trembling, reached out and touched Furiae’s cheek. Cold. Just like when he had lifted his mother’s lifeless body from the palace courtyard… it was the very same chill.</p>
<p class="para">“Please, I beg you—make haste. The High Priest’s party is already on their way to this town.”</p>
<p class="para">Now he understood why no goddess candidate had ever escaped.</p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t that they wouldn’t.
    <br>It was that they couldn’t—in this condition.
</p>
<p class="para">But even if they tried to run—what difference would it make? The priests would come for them without delay. Just like now. They’d already arrived, far too quickly to be coincidence.</p>
<p class="para">“Even if you can’t see her again… she’ll still be alive. That much won’t change.”</p>
<p class="para">The priest's voice, which had remained calm and detached until now, wavered slightly with the faintest trace of compassion. No doubt he'd spoken these words many times before, watched others accept this same cruel parting with quiet resignation.
    <br>Even if they were never to reunite—if she could just live on.
    <br>Even if that life meant enduring unrelenting pain and isolation.
</p>
<p class="para">He had lost both parents in a single day. Furiae was all he had left. And now, even she was being taken from him.</p>
<p class="para">…But still—if she could just stay alive..</p>
<p class="para">“Furiae… forgive me.”</p>
<p class="para">He had failed to protect her. Worse—he was about to cast her into the very heart of despair with his own two hands. All because he couldn’t bear to lose another family member in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="para">At some point, he realized he’d been clutching her hand. Gently, he let go. Slowly, he stood. Walked over to the door.
    <br>And then—Caim undid the latch.
</p>
<p class="para">A month passed.</p>
<p class="para">In a far-off country, Caim heard whispers—rumors that a queen had been slaughtered by a Black Dragon. That behind the scenes, a strange, sinister faction was moving—one that commanded “soldiers with crimson eyes.”
    <br>They were called the Empire (Imperial Army). And their power was growing stronger with every passing day.
</p>
<p class="para">And so, Caim became a mercenary.
    <br>Now that he knew who had been pulling the strings, there was no way he could remain silent.
</p>
<p class="para">He would kill as many Imperial soldiers as he could.
    <br>That was the only way to ease the anger and hatred smoldering inside him—the rage of losing his parents, his kingdom, and finally, his sister, without being able to do a thing to stop it.
    <br>He had no choice but to let the word “revenge” stand in for everything.
</p>
<p class="para">He tore across the battlefield, relentlessly, killing Imperial soldiers without end.
    <br>No word ever reached him of his homeland. No sign of Inuart.
    <br>Only time moved forward.
    <br>And so, six years had passed.
</p>
<p class="title">3</p>
<p class="para">The goddess lives out her brief life deep within the temple.
    <br>Hidden away, untouched by the world of mortals, she spends her days in silence.
    <br>The previous goddess, Asherah, had lived and died like so.
</p>
<p class="para">But after Furiae became the new goddess, an unexpected crisis arose—the Empire began its invasion.
    <br>From somewhere, a rumor spread: the Empire was after the sealed goddess.
    <br>Indeed, their advancing path was headed straight for the temple.
    <br>A sanctuary meant for prayer and worship had no means to defend itself; if attacked, it would surely fall.
</p>
<p class="para">And so, the high priest took action to relocate the goddess.
    <br>She was hidden away within a fortified citadel, protected by natural cliffs and deep moats.
    <br>The Union forces poured as much of their military might into the castle as possible, assigning troops to guard her.
    <br>Even the rapidly growing Empire would think twice before making a move against such a stronghold…
</p>
<p class="para">And yet, the Empire laid siege to the castle with a force that defied all reason. Upon hearing the news, Caim had rushed to join the reinforcements. But by the time they arrived, the defenses had already fallen one by one—and before his very eyes, the castle gates were breached.</p>
<p class="para">He’d only been able to scatter the enemy in a blind frenzy for a fleeting moment. By the time he managed to roll through the gate, it was painfully clear—he’d taken a grave wound.</p>
<p class="para">It felt like swinging a sword while freezing in some arctic wasteland. With each strike, his arms grew heavier; his legs dragged like they’d been shackled in lead. And on top of that, the crushing shortness of breath. Still, Caim ran. Still, he swung his blade.</p>
<p class="para">Furiae was most likely in the topmost tower. In a siege, that would be the only place to flee. But would he have the strength to make it there?</p>
<p class="para">Now and then, the sounds around him would recede, distant and muffled. Maybe sweat had gotten in his eyes—his vision was blurred. And yet, he still managed to cut down his enemies, and found himself equal parts amazed and exasperated. Maybe those five long years as a mercenary hadn’t been for nothing.</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, the corridor ended, and light spilled into his vision. He had emerged into the courtyard. This was bad. Unlike the narrow passageways, the open courtyard could easily be surrounded. But did he even have the strength left to take a longer path around?</p>
<p class="para">The keep was still far off. Time was running out.</p>
<p class="para">No, he thought, better to go around. It would be smarter. He turned on his heel, ready to trust in what strength he had left—</p>
<p class="para">And stopped.</p>
<p class="para">“…A dragon.”</p>
<p class="para">He thought at first it was a hallucination brought on by blood loss. Or maybe some other wild beast held captive. But no—mistaking a dragon was impossible, even for him. Not with <i>those</i> scales. <i>Those</i> claws. Its back was riddled with arrows, its body bound in countless chains, but there was no mistaking it.</p>
<p class="para">The Red Dragon.</p>
<p class="para">Its scales shimmered like distilled night, its eyes blazing crimson. A vision surfaced in Caim’s mind—those jaws clamped around his father’s throat, those claws rending open his mother’s chest…</p>
<p class="para">The dragon. This was the one.</p>
<p class="para">The one that took their parents from him and Furiae. The one that took peace, and country, and everything else from the people.</p>
<p class="para">Caim stepped into the courtyard. It didn’t matter if the enemy saw him. It didn’t matter if he was surrounded. He pressed forward on unsteady legs. Toward the source of it all. The one that stole everything. The one that shattered everything—</p>
<p class="para">It would pay. Here and now. He would make it pay. With pain. With death.</p>
<p class="para">"Kill me if you so desire..."</p>
<p class="para">The voice snapped him back to himself.</p>
<p class="para">Sword raised mid-swing, Caim lowered his gaze.</p>
<p class="para">"But…"</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps even speaking had become a torment—
    <br>For the dragon’s voice was ragged, cracked to the point of breaking. With each breath, thick red-black drops spilled onto the ground.
</p>
<p class="para">“You may take my life, but you will never taint my soul, wretched human.”</p>
<p class="para">And yet, it still tried to lift its head with what strength remained—
    <br>Perhaps it could not bear the thought of being looked down upon by something as lowly as a human.
</p>
<p class="para">Because his parents had been killed by one, Caim had always seen dragons as nothing more than beasts. But that wasn’t the truth.
    <br>They were creatures of vast longevity and immense intelligence—the mightiest beings in existence.
</p>
<p class="para">They were dragons—noble creatures once called <i>messengers of the gods</i>.</p>
<p class="para">There was no doubt: this Red Dragon had been captured by the Empire.
    <br>The Union, protectors of the Goddess of the Seal, would never have dared lay chains on a divine beast.
    <br>The Empire had taken it—brought it here to the battlefield, hoping to bend it to their will.
    <br>Or perhaps, judging by the blood-stained sigils scrawled into the earth, they meant to use it in some kind of ritual.
</p>
<p class="para">“Tell me, do you still want to live, dragon?”</p>
<p class="para">Caim asked, blade still raised.</p>
<p class="para">This dragon had clearly refused to bow to the Empire. This—this was the result.
    <br>Even if he didn’t strike it down now, it would die soon enough.
    <br>And he… he was no different.
    <br>In this state, he couldn’t hope to reach the castle—let alone protect Furiae.
</p>
<p class="para">“A pact! There’s no other way.”</p>
<p class="para">For both of them, this was the only path to survival.</p>
<p class="para">The dragon’s massive neck swayed slightly, as if in dark amusement.</p>
<p class="para">A <i>pact</i>—the act of exchanging hearts with something not human, and gaining a new power together.</p>
<p class="para">That’s what people said.
    <br>Whether such a thing was truly possible—whether one could even exchange hearts in the first place—Caim had no idea.
</p>
<p class="para">“What makes you think you are worthy of a pact with me?”</p>
<p class="para">The dragon let out a small sigh, what seemed to be a snort.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not.”</p>
<p class="para">Worthiness? Who cares about that?</p>
<p class="para">He leveled his blade at the dragon’s snout.
    <br>He knew full well this wasn’t a creature that could be threatened with force.
</p>
<p class="para">“I…”</p>
<p class="para">To make a pact—to bind his life to the very dragon that had killed his parents…</p>
<p class="para">If that was <i>unthinkable</i>, then no one was more unworthy than he was.</p>
<p class="para">But even so—</p>
<p class="para">“Worthy or not, I wish to live. Despise me if you will, but I shall not die…!”</p>
<p class="para">He didn’t want to die. Not yet.
    <br>Not until he had his revenge.
</p>
<p class="para">Not until he’d wiped out the Empire’s soldiers with his own hands.
    <br>Until then—
</p>
<p class="para">He couldn’t die.</p>
<p class="para">“Your answer!”</p>
<p class="para">I will live.
    <br>No matter what it takes—I’ll survive.
</p>
<p class="para">“A pact? Or death?”</p>
<p class="para">The clink of armor sounded behind him.
    <br>The dragon shut its eyes.
    <br>Caim clicked his tongue and turned around.
    <br>Imperial soldiers. A handful of them.
    <br>…Damn them. Couldn’t have picked a worse time.
</p>
<p class="para">“Even so—I’ll survive!”</p>
<p class="para">Fueled by rage, he charged.
    <br>It made him furious. Of all times, they had to interrupt this?
</p>
<p class="para">“Out of my way!”</p>
<p class="para">He struck with his sword, but the fury didn’t fade. His whole body was burning.
    <br>Was the red in his vision from the blood splattered across his face—or from the fury boiling in his veins?</p>
<p class="para">Come on.
    <br>I’ll kill every last one of you!
</p>
<p class="para">Where was this anger coming from?
    <br>Was it because they interrupted the pact?
    <br>Because of his hatred for the Empire?
    <br>No—it felt like more than that.
    <br>I…
</p>
<p class="para">“You survived?”</p>
<p class="para">The dragon’s voice came from behind him.
    <br>Before he realized it, the corpses of the Imperial soldiers lay scattered across the ground.
</p>
<p class="para">“You’re a lucky one.”</p>
<p class="para">Its voice had a hint of laughter to it, but its breath was even more ragged than before.
    <br>It was dying.
    <br>There wasn’t a moment left to lose.
</p>
<p class="para">Caim turned around.
    <br>The earth lurched beneath him.
    <br>He caught himself with his sword like a cane. Pain shot through him.
</p>
<p class="para">“Your answer…”</p>
<p class="para">Each breath felt like a hand tightening around his spine.
    <br>He didn’t have much time left either.
</p>
<p class="para">“A pact? Or death?”</p>
<p class="para">His vision blurred.
    <br>Even his own voice sounded distant.
    <br>Stumbling, legs trembling, he moved toward the dragon.
</p>
<p class="para">It still lay with its head to the ground, but slowly, it opened its eyes.</p>
<p class="para">“I swear on your will to live.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then?”</p>
<p class="para">The dragon stirred, the chains binding it cutting into its flesh.</p>
<p class="para">“Very well… a pact.”</p>
<p class="para">Caim’s right hand slipped from his sword—not by choice.
    <br>It moved on its own, as if pulled by some unseen force.
</p>
<p class="para">His fingertips were drawn toward his left breast.</p>
<p class="para">So this is how it’s done, he thought.
    <br>It didn’t matter that he didn’t know the process. It would happen anyway.
</p>
<p class="para">His bones and flesh screamed in unison.
    <br>As the pain reached its peak—agony like his body was being ripped apart—he felt something grasped in his right hand.
</p>
<p class="para">The light was too bright to keep his eyes open.
    <br>It pierced straight into his skull, like arrows into his eyeballs.
    <br>Whatever his right hand now held—whatever pulsed and throbbed with a living rhythm—was radiating that searing light.
</p>
<p class="para">His legs moved on their own.
    <br>Before he knew it, there was a similar orb of light at the end of his outstretched right hand.
    <br>His eyes burned. Unable to bear it, he shut them tight.
    <br>Even then, the light was blinding.
</p>
<p class="para">When the inside of his eyelids turned as white as snow, the light suddenly vanished.
    <br>His empty right hand hung in midair.
    <br>Caim instinctively looked between his hands.
    <br>He clenched his fist, then opened it.
    <br>The sensation of being controlled, as though by some outside force, was completely gone.
    <br>The searing pain that had threatened to devour him had disappeared without a trace.
    <br>There was no more difficulty breathing.
    <br>In an instant, his wounds had healed.
</p>
<p class="para">By his side, countless arrows and chains wrapped in coils snapped apart with a loud sound.
    <br>Wings, unscathed and unmarred, spread wide.
    <br>A roar shook the very air.
    <br>The dragon turned to him, as if to say, "Get on."
    <br>As Caim leapt onto her back, her wings cut through the air, and they took off.
</p>
<p class="para">The first flight was surprisingly brief.
    <br>The sound of the wind roared in his ears. They soared in a graceful arc, but before long, they began descending.
    <br>With a single burst of flame, the dragon incinerated the Imperial soldiers near the keep, then landed gently.
</p>
<p class="para">The distance from the courtyard to the innermost keep was covered in an instant.
    <br>A long, seemingly impossible distance that just moments ago had seemed so uncertain.
    <br>Caim couldn’t help but chuckle inwardly. Of course, a dragon would look down upon humans.
</p>
<p class="para">He jumped off the dragon's back.
    <br>His body felt incredibly light, almost weightless.
    <br>Even the longsword he had gripped with both hands felt easy to wield with just one.
    <br>He had clearly gained a power far beyond that of a mere human.
    <br>This is it, he thought, with a faint smile.
</p>
<p class="para">At the entrance leading further into the castle, a charred mass that once must have been a soldier lay in a heap.
    <br>From here on, the path narrowed—it was a place he would have to go alone.
    <br>He turned to look back at the dragon.
    <br>He was about to tell her to wait here, but stopped short in shock.
</p>
<p class="para">"……"</p>
<p class="para">His mouth froze in mid-motion, words stuck in his throat.</p>
<p class="para">"Lost your voice?""</p>
<p class="para">He had forgotten that a pact came with a price.
    <br>In exchange for the immense power, one would lose the most important bodily function to them.
    <br>And the mark of that loss would manifest as a symbol on the body.
    <br>Most likely, his own tongue bore that mark now…
</p>
<p class="para">"A sharp tongue is of no use. A light price to pay for the pact."</p>
<p class="para">The dragon said this with a hint of amusement.
    <br>Even though it was his pact partner, to the dragon, humans were nothing more than subjects of contempt.
    <br>But why?
    <br>Why had the price been his voice?
    <br>He had never placed much importance on it.
    <br>In fact, he had sometimes thought words could be nothing but trouble.
    <br>And yet, to lose it as the cost of the pact…
</p>
<p class="para">"Do not worry. I shall become your voice."</p>
<p class="para">What does that mean? I wondered if something like that was even possible, but it seemed my confusion had been understood. The dragon nodded.</p>
<p class="para">“We, as those with a pact, can exchange ‘voices’ with humans.”</p>
<p class="para"><i>Voice? But my voice was lost as the price of the pact, wasn’t it?</i></p>
<p class="para">“It is not that voice. If I were to put it in the terms of humans… it is more like ‘thoughts,’ perhaps.”</p>
<p class="para">So, does that mean she can read my mind? Indeed, we were communicating like this now.</p>
<p class="para">“I do not engage in such vile acts as peering deep into a human's heart.”</p>
<p class="para">The dragon shook her head, as if the very thought were an insult.</p>
<p class="para">"Go. I will wait here for your return."</p>
<p class="para"><i>And if I die in there? Will you just wait here forever?</i></p>
<p class="para">"If you die, I will know it at once. My life will end along with yours."</p>
<p class="para">Understood, Caim signaled with a raise of his hand. <i>Rest here. I’ll tear through them.</i> However many Imperial soldiers were inside, he would cut them down to the last.</p>
<p class="para">"You won't survive on hatred alone."</p>
<p class="para">Brushing off the dragon’s sardonic voice, Caim turned away and sprinted into the dark. <i>I’ll survive</i>, he told himself. Hatred had been enough to carry him this far. It would be enough now. Not that the gods’ exalted emissaries could ever understand the strength that human hatred could give rise to — nor did he care if they did.</p>
<p class="para">The dim corridor was littered with the bodies of fallen Union soldiers, slaughtered by the Empire. Each corpse was brutally, savagely cut down.</p>
<p class="para"><i>I’ll avenge you all. Not one of them will get away.</i></p>
<p class="para">As he moved, what he thought was just another corpse suddenly stirred. The man still clung to life.</p>
<p class="para">"The Goddess... top... floor..."</p>
<p class="para">Caim wanted to answer, but no voice came. Whether the man could still see him or not, Caim gave a small nod.</p>
<p class="para">"…Inu…art…"</p>
<p class="para"><i>Inuart? He’s here? </i>Caim crouched low, trying to catch the rest, but by then the soldier had already fallen still. Most likely, when Inuart heard that Goddess Furiae’s hiding place had been attacked, he had rushed to her side without hesitation.</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, footsteps echoed through the passage. Caim sprang to his feet. Shadows moved at the far end.</p>
<p class="para">Imperial soldiers. Without hesitating, Caim lunged forward, driving his blade straight through. Two figures in black armor went flying. Their bodies felt strangely light — not at all like men clad in full plate.</p>
<p class="para">Even as more enemies flooded in, even as they tried to encircle him, Caim felt no fear. The soldiers moved sluggishly, their stances riddled with openings. His blade carved through them like paper. There was no sensation of cutting flesh at all — it felt more like striking at wooden posts. He felt a flash of disgust for his earlier struggle against such feeble opponents.</p>
<p class="para">So this is the power granted by the pact.</p>
<p class="para">No matter how he swung, fatigue never touched him. If anything, every slash filled him with greater strength. He could feel the twisted smile spreading across his lips. Drenched in a storm of blood, he laughed, drunk on the heavy scent of it.</p>
<p class="para">When he came back to himself, there were no enemies left. All that remained were corpses, scattered across the ground. The slaughter had taken so little time it left him almost disappointed. Still riding the last of the adrenaline, he bounded up the stairwell.</p>
<p class="para">He had never met a pact-partner before. Even though such overwhelming strength was within reach, there were still so few of them. <i>Why?</i></p>
<p class="para">The thought came to him once the fury drained away and cold reason returned.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Were they afraid of the price they’d have to pay? No. Humans weren’t so timid — nor so free of greed.</i></p>
<p class="para">Only those who harbor a bottomless darkness within can form a pact. Only those with the will to live at any cost, and the selfishness to sacrifice others to survive.</p>
<p class="para"><i>—“Negative emotions draw spirits and monsters alike.”</i></p>
<p class="para">Caim stopped in his tracks without thinking, glancing around.
    <br>He had definitely heard the dragon’s voice.
</p>
<p class="para"><i>—"Even if we are far apart, there is no difficulty in exchanging 'voices.'"</i></p>
<p class="para">If that was true, then being apart didn’t mean she couldn’t peek into his heart either.</p>
<p class="para"><i>—“How many times must I say it — I did not peek. That voice of yours is so loud, it’s impossible not to hear you. And you can’t exactly plug your ears, now can you?</i></p>
<p class="para">Her voice followed, laced with weariness.</p>
<p class="para"><i>—“Honestly. Humans…”</i></p>
<p class="para">A sigh, heavy with exasperation, echoed in his mind.</p>
<p class="para"><i>—“It’s a skill so natural that even the lowest of monsters could wield it without effort.”</i></p>
<p class="para">Ignoring the dragon's scornful voice, Caim dashed up the stairs once again.</p>
<p class="para"><i>—“Hurry. I sense something ominous.”</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>I don’t need you to tell me! Shut up!</i></p>
<p class="para">The moment he emerged from the stairwell into another corridor, an Imperial soldier leapt out, trying to ambush him.
    <br>Caim easily sidestepped and smashed the soldier’s skull. After that, there was no more sound.
</p>
<p class="para">As he reached the top of the stairs, a scream rang out.
    <br>Through the open door ahead, he could see figures — Imperial knights.
</p>
<p class="para">Unlike the common rabble crowding around the castle, Imperial Knights rarely showed themselves on the front lines.
    <br>Though Caim had fought countless battles as a mercenary, he had never crossed blades with them directly.
    <br>He had, however, seen their corpses before. Even at a glance, their distinctive armor was unmistakable.
</p>
<p class="para">—Furiae…!</p>
<p class="para">Caim sprinted at full speed.</p>
<p class="para">The short distance felt agonizingly long.</p>
<p class="para">Five knights burst from the room toward him.</p>
<p class="para">Out of my way!</p>
<p class="para">With a single sweep of his sword, he cut them all down and threw himself into the room.</p>
<p class="para">"Caim!"</p>
<p class="para">Inuart's shocked face.</p>
<p class="para">"D-Don't come any closer!"</p>
<p class="para">The last remaining knight grabbed the woman in white and shouted.
    <br>The woman, who had been staring downward, lifted her face. Her eyes widened slightly.
</p>
<p class="para">Furiae?
    <br>Furiae… is it really you?
    <br>I thought I'd never see you again in this life.
</p>
<p class="para">"If you come any closer, the goddess will—"</p>
<p class="para">Caim didn’t let him finish.</p>
<p class="para">He lunged, plunging his blade into the blood-colored eyes of the knight.
    <br>The armored body was hurled against the wall, and Caim drove the sword into the man’s throat.
</p>
<p class="para">Unforgivable. I won’t forgive you.
    <br>Six blank years—
    <br>Whose fault was it that Furiae and I had to meet again like this, in such a place?
</p>
<p class="para">Furiae’s face, drained of life like a puppet’s—
    <br>It was all because of them. Everything, all of it—
</p>
<p class="para">Again and again, Caim brought his sword down.
    <br>The armor crumpled.
    <br>The blood pooled, and he swung his blade through it without stopping.
</p>
<p class="para">"That's enough! Caim, he's already dead!"</p>
<p class="para">Inuart’s voice finally brought him back to himself.
    <br>Caim yanked his sword free from the corpse.
</p>
<p class="para">Had he scared Furiae?</p>
<p class="para">He turned—and saw her white robes soaked red with blood.</p>
<p class="para">But Furiae showed no fear.
    <br>She stood there vaguely, as if stunned.
    <br>It would have been better if terror had simply paralyzed her emotions.
    <br>Instead, her face seemed to have forgotten fear entirely.
</p>
<p class="para">The lively young girl from five years ago was nowhere to be seen.
    <br>The features were unmistakably Furiae’s.
    <br>And yet it was as if everything inside her had been hollowed out.
</p>
<p class="para">"You’re as intense as ever."</p>
<p class="para">Inuart.
    <br>Even after five years, he hadn’t changed.
    <br>But then, neither had Caim.
</p>
<p class="para">"But you saved us. Once again, I owe you my life."</p>
<p class="para">Caim opened his mouth to answer — then remembered.
    <br>He had no voice to speak with.
</p>
<p class="para">"...Hm? What’s wrong?"</p>
<p class="para">How was he supposed to explain it?</p>
<p class="para">For now, he pointed to his throat.</p>
<p class="para">Inuart only looked confused.</p>
<p class="para">Caim mimed speaking and pointed to his throat again, repeating the gesture over and over.</p>
<p class="para">"You... you lost your voice…?"</p>
<p class="para">At last, Inuart seemed to understand.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, he wouldn’t know that it was the price of the pact.
    <br>Without a word, Caim opened his mouth wide and stuck out his tongue, showing him.
</p>
<p class="para">"You mean... you’re a pact-partner?"</p>
<p class="para">Caim nodded.</p>
<p class="para">Inuart and Furiae exchanged glances.</p>
<p class="para">"I see..."</p>
<p class="para">Inuart made no attempt to hide his unease.
    <br>It seemed he hadn't changed — he was still so straightforward that it was almost foolish.
</p>
<p class="para">But Furiae showed no reaction at all.
    <br>No expression, no emotion.
</p>
<p class="para">When he thought about it, it made sense.
    <br>Furiae had been forced to abandon everything to become the Goddess of the Seal.
    <br>Compared to that, losing only his voice was nothing.
</p>
<p class="para">A heavy, suffocating silence fell between them.</p>
<p class="para">Furiae spoke hardly at all.</p>
<p class="para">And Caim—even if he wanted to—could not speak.</p>
<p class="para">Whenever Inuart fell silent, so too did the others, and the silence dragged on.</p>
<p class="para">"Hey, Caim..."</p>
<p class="para">At last, Inuart broke the quiet.</p>
<p class="para">"I’m thinking of taking Furiae to the Elf village."</p>
<p class="para">The Elf village was known for its perpetual neutrality.
    <br>A small settlement, hidden deep within the forests, yet said to be as well-defended as any fortress.
</p>
<p class="para">"If we take her there, the Imperial army shouldn’t be able to reach her so easily."</p>
<p class="para">Was that really true?
    <br>Could they be so sure that a village's neutrality would guarantee safety?
</p>
<p class="para">"To escort a goddess around like this is an act of grave impiety... but we have no choice, do we?"</p>
<p class="para">It was true.
    <br>The fall of this castle was only a matter of time.
    <br>They had to get Furiae out—find a safe haven for her as soon as possible.
</p>
<p class="para">"She was once my betrothed," Inuart said quietly. "I can't let her die."</p>
<p class="para">The word "betrothed" pricked at Caim’s chest, if only slightly.</p>
<p class="para">"She's your beloved sister too, isn’t she?" Inuart added. "Before she's the Goddess, she's still Furiae."</p>
<p class="para">Once Inuart made up his mind, there was no changing it.
    <br>Caim had known that since they were children.
    <br>But what about Furiae herself?
</p>
<p class="para">Caim shifted his gaze to her.</p>
<p class="para">"I suppose I must continue living," she said.</p>
<p class="para">Her voice was flat, devoid of any feeling.
    <br>Inuart's words had stirred no visible reaction.
</p>
<p class="para">"As the Goddess that maintains the world's seal."</p>
<p class="para">She spoke as though it were someone else's life, someone else's duty.</p>
<p class="para">For a moment, Caim glimpsed the years she must have endured alone.</p>
<p class="para">"It's all right, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="para">Caim nodded. Then shrugged his shoulders in resignation.
    <br>Whatever he might say, Inuart would not listen anyway.
</p>
<p class="para">"I see," Inuart said, smiling in relief.
    <br>He picked up a fallen chair nearby and set it upright.
</p>
<p class="para">"Then let’s have a toast."</p>
<p class="para">He spoke playfully, lifting a harp in his hands.
    <br>Caim frowned.
    <br>Was this really the time for such nonsense?
</p>
<p class="para">"Take a moment to rest," Inuart said.
    <br>"You’ve been running nonstop until now, haven’t you?"
</p>
<p class="para">His fingers brushed against the harp strings.
    <br>A melody filled the room—gentle and nostalgic.
</p>
<p class="para">It had been so long since Caim had heard that sound.
    <br>No doubt, the same was true for Furiae.
</p>
<p class="para">Maybe this was enough, for now.</p>
<p class="para">The sweet strains of the harp drifted through the air.
    <br>It felt, almost, like they had returned to the past.
</p>
<p class="para">Of course, the bloodshed continued downstairs, and the three of them were no longer innocent children.
    <br>Even so...
</p>
<p class="para">Caim turned his eyes toward Furiae.</p>
<p class="para">Her face, so hollow and lifeless before, now seemed touched by a faint, fleeting calm.</p>
