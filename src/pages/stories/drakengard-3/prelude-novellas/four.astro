<p style="margin-top: 0.4cm; font-size: 200%;">Transcriber: Dr_Mint</a></p>
<p class="para">“Five! I know it was you. Don’t
just leave your clothes lying on the floor!”</p>
<p class="para">I’ve already yelled at her to
clean it up. So what if the house is abandoned and no one lives here?
It isn’t ours to do with as we please. We’re here to rest from
our travels and take shelter—that’s <i>it</i>. And when we leave,
we need to put things back the way we found them. We’re not slobs.</p>
<p class="para">But Five has been shedding her
clothes and spilling her food like she owns the place. She ought to
try cleaning up after herself. Well, I suppose it’s to be expected
from the youngest in any family.</p>
<p class="para">I start to fold her dress and catch
myself grimacing. There’s a big tear in the seam under the sleeve.
Oh, of course. She probably forgot all about this dress the second
she found something else to change into. “What am I going to do
with her?”</p>
<p class="para">I let out a big sigh. Not only do I
clean up after Five, but I also wind up mending her clothes, too. But
she’s all thumbs, anyway; if I made her do the needlework, we’d
just wind up with more rags. Either that or she’d prick her finger
or something and make a big scene. Best to avoid the trouble and
handle this myself. One open seam won’t take more than a few
minutes.</p>
<p class="para">I spread out the dress to check it
for other tears, and now I’ve noticed there’s hair all over the
floor. “Three,” I groan. “Not you, too.”</p>
<p class="para">Three has made a bad habit of this:
sitting down any old place and then getting her hair all over
everything when she cuts it. It’s not my older sister’s fault her
hair grows faster than other people’s, but honestly, I swear she
does this for kicks. I mean, if it’s that much of a hassle, she
could just chop it off at shoulder length. But Three cuts the ends;
she’ll just grab a clump of hair and <i>snick, snick</i> away at it
with her scissors. I think she enjoys it. You could almost call it a
hobby—a really weird one, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="para">In fact, she’s a little weird in
general. All right, a lot weird. Exceedingly weird. Actually, I’m
still mincing words. She’s a certifiable loon.</p>
<p class="para">As I think this, I hear the <i>snick,
snick</i> getting closer. Here she comes. “Three, would you stop
getting your hair all—” But <i>over the place</i> is dead on
arrival. Three has been cutting her hair as she walks. With each
<i>snick,</i> more of her silky hair flutters toward the floor.</p>
<p class="para">“Need something?” she says. The
fallen hair is getting on everything. Her brazenness has knocked the
words right out of me. If it were Five, I would already be yelling,
“Stop making a mess!”</p>
<p class="para">“Three, maybe you shouldn’t cut
your hair while you walk.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="para">“Why not? Because... Because
scissors are sharp, right? If your hand slips, you could hurt
yourself.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll be fine.” Three cuts off
another lock of hair as if to say: <i>See? Not dangerous.</i> I feel
my shoulders slump. What a waste of time. I should have known who I
was dealing with right from the start.</p>
<p class="para">“All right, you’ll be fine. But
could you please pick up the hair you’ve gotten all over
everything? This isn’t our house.” I shudder to think what the
next people to come in will think if they find mounds of hair all
over the floor. I know I’d be creeped out. “Here you go.” I
hold out a broom realizing as I do that it’s another waste of time.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m tired,” says Three. Sure
enough, she flops down on her butt, keels over, and is asleep before
I can blink. She’s not <i>pretending</i> to be asleep; she’s
actually doing it. It’s incredible, in a way.</p>
<p class="para">I can’t sleep if you so much as
switch out my pillow, but Three—she can deal with a different
mattress, or no mattress at all, or even just a patch of dirt. If she
can get horizontal, she can sleep. You could raise the roof right
next to her and she wouldn’t care. No matter how dirty her clothes
get, she doesn’t mind. As delicate as she looks, Three is a tough
one to faze.</p>
<p class="para">It’s a shame. Three has the
prettiest face of all of us. But despite being a beautiful young
woman, she’s impudent and slovenly and just plain odd. I doubt
anyone would believe it if you told them.</p>
<p class="para">What a shame about her hair too.
It’s straight and lustrous and feels just like silk, and here she
is clumsily hacking it to pieces. If I had hair like that, I’d cut
it nice and even, or at least do it up properly. And if I had Three’s
face, wouldn’t catch me rolling around on the floor. I would want
to be <i>presentable</i>. I can’t fathom how someone could be born
this pretty and wreck it all with bad hair and worse behavior. Three
is frittering away nature’s gifts. She doesn’t even seem the
slightest bit interested in using her head, as smart as she is.</p>
<p class="para">Maybe that’s what separates the
loons from the non-loons. I bet loons never give any thought to
falling in love or leading ordinary, happy lives.</p>
<p class="para">Once I’ve put a coat on Three so
she doesn’t catch a cold, I clean up the hair on the floor and
stitch up Five’s dress. I’ve really gotten the short end of the
stick, haven’t I?</p>
<p class="para">Three may be strange beyond
reproach, but I’ve got to do something about Five. We’re hurting
her in the long run by letting her act spoiled and take people for
granted all the time just because she’s the youngest. Today, I need
to finally give her a good talking-to.</p>
<p class="para">And how unfair is that? I’m sure I
must have been the youngest child up until Five was born, but I have
no memory of it. As far back as I can remember, Five has been there
and I’ve been on big sister duty as second youngest. Grown-ups tell
me I need to “tough it out” because I’m older, as if <i>that</i>
makes any sense. When have I ever begged to have my way or burdened
people the way Five does?</p>
<p class="para">You know, I’m probably not cut out
to be the youngest child anyway. My conscience and common sense would
get in the way if I tried to pull one of Five’s selfish tricks. The
first thing to jump to mind would be how much I’m putting other
people out. And more than anything—</p>
<p class="para">“Four? Did you want to see me?”</p>
<p class="para"><i>This.</i> I can’t be this
smooth a customer. Never in a million years will I have the brass to
wait until right <i>after</i> someone finishes mending my clothes to
come crawling in.</p>
<p class="para">“You know you’re not supposed to
leave your clothes lying around. How many times do I have to tell
you? And look what you did to the seam!”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, that’s not me.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t want to hear it. I
stitched it up for you this time, but next time you’re on your
own.”</p>
<p class="para">“It really wasn’t me! Honest.”
The nerve of her. Who but Five could ever be a big enough slouch to
try and pin the blame on someone else?</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, Four. Sorry!” says a
tomboyish voice. “That one’s my fault.” My older sister Two is
scratching herself when she turns up. She can get a little rough
around the edges, but what baffles me is that it comes across as
lovable. If I acted like that, people would probably mistake me for
an actual boy, not some lovable tomboy. And if Five tried it, they’d
think she popped a screw. Why is Two the only one who gets to be able
to pull it off?</p>
<p class="para">Well, anyway.</p>
<p class="para">“But, Two, this is Five’s
dress.” It doesn’t have her name written on it, but I’m pretty
good at remembering whose clothes are whose. When you have to pick up
after everyone and mend their clothes, you get pretty good at telling
people’s belongings apart. So the dress is clearly Five’s. The
thing is, Two would never lie to me...</p>
<p class="para">“Yeah. It <i>was</i> Five’s
dress.” Aha. Mystery solved. So that’s what happened. I knew Two
wouldn’t lie to me. “Was” means she got the dress as a
hand-me-down. It makes sense. Total sense. No further explanation
needed. I get it. Please don’t go there, Five!</p>
<p class="para">But she does.</p>
<p class="para">“The dress was squeezing me so
hard I just couldn’t wear it anymore.” Five sticks out her chest
as she explains, and I feel a tinge of anger. A girl her age
shouldn’t be this developed, let alone flaunt it. It’s sick. She
ought to be ashamed of herself. I mean, what is it they say? You’re
born with either tits or wits?</p>
<p class="para">“Five said she was done with it,
so I took it off her hands.” Two explains with a big smile,
completely unfazed by our little sister’s pig show. Would it hurt
Two to reprimand Five just once? It’s a big sister’s duty, if you
ask me. “But when I tried it on, I flexed a little too hard and
...<i>rrrip.</i>”</p>
<p class="para">“The seam burst.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bingo! That’s right, Four.”
Two’s muscles are overpowered, so she’s always breaking things or
punching holes in the wall. But then she says, “Oh no!” and turns
white as a sheet. It’s kind of ironic that one of us with the best
intentions does the most damage. She’d be a real catch otherwise.</p>
<p class="para">“Can you <i>believe</i> I ruined a
dress someone just gave me? I went to find a needle and thread to see
if I could fix it up.”</p>
<p class="para">“Here you are, Two.” I hold out
the dress, which is all stitched up now. Unlike Five, Two can take
care of herself, but she’s a little clumsy. She’s decent enough
with her fingers, but a little disorganized, you might say. So I tend
to get things taken care of first. It doesn’t upset me though,
since Two isn’t trying to unload her chores on people.</p>
<p class="para">“Whoa! Hang on. You’re kidding.
You did this for me? This is amazing! How’d you do it so fast? It’s
perfect!” Two will never flatter you or dole out empty compliments.
Her praise comes from the heart. Everything about her does; she’s
cheerful, eager, kind, compassionate.</p>
<p class="para">But my sister is so honest sometimes
that I worry about her. Those same qualities can be flipped around
and used against you. People like that are easy to trick and to take
advantage of, right?</p>
<p class="para">Which is bad enough in itself, but
Two is likable and attractive. It wouldn’t surprise if unsavory
sorts came up to her with less than good intentions. She projects a
sort of helplessness and flightiness which makes her look like an
easy mark. And, in fact, she probably <i>is</i> an easy mark.</p>
<p class="para">But knowing her, even if she did get
burned, she’d probably bounce right back and convince herself it
was a one-time mistake. I’m sure she’d say “This time I’ll
meet Mr. Right,” and keep letting men use her and then toss her
aside. Another troubling thought.</p>
<p class="para">I mean, someone as attractive as her
shouldn’t be throwing away her life to chase after a bunch of
worthless jerks, right? With her good looks? Talk about going
downhill. What a tragedy. It worries me sick just imagining. That’s
right. I’m only thinking of her!</p>
<p class="para">“Four, you’re the <i>best!</i>
Let me go try it on.” I hear Two squealing in delight as she does,
and next she’s saying, “Yay! It’s a perfect fit!” as she
turns in circles. It almost feels like <i>I’m</i> the big sister.</p>
<p class="para">“Well? What do you think? Huh?”
Once Five and I manage a nod, Two’s face lights up in a big grin
and she wheels around. “I’ve got to show this to One!” she
gasps, and flies out of the room without even shutting the door. She
can be such a child. Well, she <i>is</i> a child. This whole journey,
we’ve been going around trouncing villains and monsters that have
been tormenting innocent people. It’s been easy to forget that
we’re all still kids. And Five doesn’t help with all that
flaunting and the filth she spouts.</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, Four.” The indecent
creature is slinking up behind me right now. I’ve got a bad feeling
about this. “Now did I lie to you or not?”</p>
<p class="para">“No. I misjudged you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why do you always have to treat
me like the villain? You hurt my feelings,” she says with
absolutely no hurt in her voice. I can feel her pressing right up
against my back.</p>
<p class="para">“I was wrong,” I manage.</p>
<p class="para">“Is that it? Aren’t you going to
say you’re sorry?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry,” I manage again.</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t <i>hear</i> you.”</p>
<p class="para">“I said, I’m <i>SORRY!</i>”
Ugh. I’m not usually this easy to get to. She thinks she’s so
smart. Jerk. “Could you get away from me now? You’re crushing
me.”</p>
<p class="para">Her and her oversized bazoom! It
ticks me off!</p>
<p class="para">“Mmm,” she moans. “You don’t
like being crushed? Why?<br/>
Because you can’t do it with those
pancakes?”</p>
<p class="para">“WELL, EXCUSE ME AND MY PANCAKES!
LIKE I’D EVER WANT TO BE LIKE YOU! GET AWAY FROM ME, IT’S HOT
ENOUGH IN HERE! AND DON’T ‘MMM’ ME! YOU’RE TOO YOUNG TO BE
ACTING LIKE SOME FILTHY WHORE. I BET THE FOOD YOU EAT GOES RIGHT TO
YOUR TITS AND YOU’VE GOT THE BRAINS OF A STUPID COW. YOU STUPID
DUMBSHIT! DUMBSHIT, DUMBSHIT, DUMBSHIT!”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, Four! Stop! You’re so
scary.”</p>
<p class="para">“SHUT UP! BITCHCOW! GO EAT SOME
BITCHGRASS!” Soon, I’m grabbing everything within reach and
throwing it at her. But she writhes and moans and dodges it all,
which only manages to piss me off even more.</p>
<p class="para"><i>I hate you so much! All of you! I
despise you! I know I’ll never be lovable like Two or beautiful
like Three. I know that compared to Five I’m a pancake! I hate
myself! I hate my face! My body! I’m not pretty or lovable and I
have the most average face you can imagine. My arms and legs are
gangly and I look like a twig that can never get my stupid hair to
straighten out!</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>And these horrid nails! I hate
them so much I just want to die. They keep growing and growing and
get all curly and weird if I don’t clip them, or else they crack or
they get caught on everything. They’re useless and I wish I could
just rip them straight off. My arms are useless, my legs are useless,
my face is useless—all of me is useless!</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Maybe ... I’m useless.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Me? Useless? No! I’m not the
one who’s useless!</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>YOU ARE, YOU WORTHLESS
FOUL-MOUTHED SLUT! IF YOU THINK YOU AND THOSE FLOPPY SACKS OF MEAT
ARE SPECIAL, THEN YOU’VE GOT ANOTHER GODDAMN THING COMING! A SHIT
WOULD TURN ITS NOSE UP AT YOU, YOU’RE NOTHING, SO FUCK OFF!</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>YOU TOO! YOU MUSCLE-BOUND
LOVEY-DOVEY FREAK! AND YOU, YOU FUCKED-UP-WACK-JOB SCISSOR FIEND!
YOUR BIG FAT BRAIN DOESN’T MEAN JACK SHIT! YOU AND YOUR STUPID
PRETTY SKIN. IF IT’S SO PRETTY, WHY DON’T I RIP IT RIGHT OFF SO
YOU CAN STARE AT IT? I’LL YANK IT RIGHT OVER YOUR BITCH SHOULDERS
AND TEAR IT INTO TINY FUCKING PIECES SO YOU CAN WATCH ME </i><i><b>GRIND</b></i><i>
IT INTO THE FLOOR!</i></p>
<p class="para">I’m laughing maniacally now. <i>I
FEEL BETTER! I FEEL </i><i><b>MUCH</b></i><i> BETTER!</i></p>
<p class="para">When I come around, the room is in
shambles. And yet there’s Three, still sound asleep. The fact that
she managed to stay dead to the world through that much commotion has
to make her some kind of prodigy. A loon prodigy.</p>
<p class="para">Five must have fled the scene a
while ago. She’s not very smart, but she is smooth.</p>
<p class="para">“I am such an idiot.” I know I
have to get this cleaned up fast. Whoever makes the mess has to clean
it up. Everyone knows that. But when I see my sisters not doing it, I
start to feel pretty stupid being the only one playing by the rules.</p>
<p class="para">I put back the chairs and table I
had upended, pick up the decanter, and wipe the floor. Oh no, I can’t
believe it. Was I throwing dishes? Five hadn’t bothered to clear
her place, and even now there are bits of food stuck to the pieces.</p>
<p class="para">I sigh. “Why me?” But while Five
may not have cleaned the dishes up, I’m the one who threw them and
broke them. This is on me. From now on, I’ll have to keep my temper
tantrums to a minimum. Even if I get mad, I need to hold it in.
Because no matter what I say or do, I’m only hurting myself in the
end.</p>
<p class="para">When at last the cleaning is done, I
take a seat in a chair. I sure am tired. Maybe not on Three’s
level—but really tired.</p>
<p class="para">“Is anyone here?”</p>
<p class="para">My head has been facing down on the
table, but I look up. My eldest sister has just come in.</p>
<p class="para">“One, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, I’m glad you’re here,
Four. Can you help me?”</p>
<p class="para">“Should I wake Three up?”</p>
<p class="para">After just a glance at Three, who is
still sleeping like a log on the floor, One shakes her head. “Leave
her be. You’ll more than do.” <i>You’ll more than do.</i> I
hear the words again in my head. They make me happy. One appreciates
me...</p>
<p class="para">Of all my sisters, One is the
brightest, and the most knowledgeable, and the most dependable. She
is responsible and just. She might not be lovable like Two or
beautiful like Three, but her every expression and gesture exudes
wisdom. That’s why she’s my role model. I can’t do anything
about my face, but I can always get wiser.</p>
<p class="para">Also, One has pancakes like me. For
now, anyway.</p>
<p class="para">“One, what do you need help with?”
I ask as I walk a few steps behind her.</p>
<p class="para">“Fixing a cart. I got us one at a
nearby farm.”</p>
<p class="para">“A cart? What for?”</p>
<p class="para">“There’s something we’ll need
to carry once we get where we’re going next.” As I look at her in
profile like this, the resolve on her face is pronounced. This is the
expression she makes before going into battle. And we won’t be
doing it for ourselves. It will be for someone else: people who are
suffering. One isn’t the sort to turn a blind eye to injustice.</p>
<p class="para">But sometimes I feel sorry for her
when I see her like this; she has so many responsibilities. And she’s
not even the oldest of us, really. She’s only in this position
because she got sort of ... bumped up the ladder, you might say. The
truth is, One is someone’s little sister, too. Someone else is
supposed to be eldest and shoulder all this responsibility and tell
us what to do...</p>
<p class="para">“Um... Listen. You know I’m here
to do everything I can to help you, right? You don’t have to make
every problem your own.”</p>
<p class="para">One seems a little surprised at
first, but then her eyes soften and she replies, “Thank you.” Two
is unreliable, Three is weird, Five is selfish. That means I’ve got
to help One. As dependable as she is, she’s trying to fill the
shoes of someone else, and that can’t be easy.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Don’t worry, I’ll be there
for you. That’s what little sisters do. Well, at least this little.
Right, One?</i></p>
<p class="para">“Huh?” When I wake up, One is
gone. The cart we were supposed to fix and the vacant house we had
borrowed are gone, too. I’m in the same bed I always sleep in. “Oh
... it was just a dream.”</p>
<p class="para">Of course it was. After all, we’re
all grown up now, and our journey is over. I used to think we could
still go back to those days, when the five of us traveled together,
but too much has changed.</p>
<p class="para">I find myself wishing I dreamed of
an older memory. One from way far back, when we had Zero, who was
stronger and more beautiful than any of us. Back when I loved her,
and admired her, and tried to be just like her.</p>
<p class="para">But then, I still love her. She’s
my sister. She’s family. I still believe she’ll go back to the
way she was so we can all live together again. So we can all be happy
again.</p>
<p class="para">And maybe I won’t mind if there’s
one or two less of us.</p>
