in a never-ending spiral of life and death.

We're scanners. We scout mission locations and determine the capabilities of our enemies—the machine lifeforms.
<br><br>Oh, and sometimes we hack enemy systems, although we're not particularly good at combat.
<br>We spend most of our time alone—working behind the scenes, I guess you'd say.

<br>I mean, I'm a scanner, you know?
<br>I can't even equip more than one weapon at a time.
<br>Still, it made me happy to go on missions with her.
<br>It was nice not being alone anymore.

he gains unauthorized access to Bunker data.

<p class="para">Ancient humans purchased all kinds of stuff here.
<br>Some even enjoyed just looking at products without actually buying anything.
<br>According to the records, that was called "window shopping."
<br>Humans sure did some fascinating things, huh?
<br>Hey, how about we try it sometime, 2B?
<br>The "window shopping" thing, I mean.

<p class="para">We're soldiers created for battle. There's no point in us engaging in senseless activities like shopping in a ruin.</p>

<br>If there's no more war, then us combat androids won't have to fight anymore. Besides, I bet window shopping is fun!

<p class="para">Saying that, 2B turned and walked away.
<br><br>There was an air of shame in her movements,
a hint of sadness in her voice.
<br><br>We spent a day fishing together in the flooded city.
<br><br>We were there to study marine resources,
but weren't able to catch the fish we needed.
<br><br>We didn't have anything to talk about,
so we just stared out over the sea as we worked.
<br><br>The breeze was warm, with a touch of salt.
<br><br>Sunlight danced over the surface of the water.
<br><br>I still remember those useless details.
<br><br>My favorite memory is from the incident in the city ruins.
<br><br>Right after we began our mission, I pissed off a boar.
<br><br>It ended up chasing us all day.
<br><br>We weren't aware that there were creatures
stronger than machine lifeforms.
<br><br>We finally had to run up a building to get away.
<br><br>As we climbed,
we debated whether we should stop our investigation
of machine lifeforms and focus on the boars instead.
<br><br>Once we reached the top, we took in the entire city.
<br><br>Crumbled buildings covered in green...
<br><br>Animals and plants more numerous than in the old world...
<br><br>The smell of wind and the sound of rain...
<br><br>It's one of my most treasured memories.
<br><br>The two of us visited many places together.
<br><br>Not for fun, of course, but on missions.
<br><br>We found areas where even walking was difficult,
and fought fierce battles against giant machines.
<br><br>But my memories of days spent doing nothing with 2B
stand out more than those of any battle.
<br><br>Soon, those memories will also disappear
along with my consciousness data.
<br><br>Still, I'm glad the me I am now was able to be with you.
<br><br>Goodbye...2B.
