<p class="para">“I’ll… accept my sins.”</p>
<p class="para">I spoke the words quietly.</p>
<p class="para">“Why?”</p>
<p class="para">The boy—the Shadowlord—also answered in a calm voice.
    <br>He was me, and I was him.
    <br>Reflections of each other, we shared a single wish.</p>
<p class="para">Maybe choosing to destroy the world was a mistake.
    <br>But even so, I had arrived at one undeniable truth.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah… she must have wished not to lose it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Lose what?”</p>
<p class="para">The Shadowlord’s voice held a trace of scorn.
    <br>What I remembered were the encounters and memories across countless worlds—
bonds born within them.
<br>And the radiance of people living across those countless worlds, across billions of moments in time, pouring into me through the antenna.</p>
<p class="para">"…She believes in the hope that follows after us—the light of the worlds to come.”</p>
<p class="para">It’s true that we may have chosen wrongly.
    <br>But—now, at last, I understand.
    <br>There is still light.
    <br>It hasn’t gone out yet.
    <br>That’s why Yonah smiled as she looked upon the memories of the people.</p>
<p class="para">The Shadowlord stared at me, as if trying to change my mind with the strength of his gaze.
    <br>I met his eyes with the same intensity—nearly a glare.</p>
<p class="para">“I figured you’d say that.”</p>
<p class="para">A flicker of resignation passed through his eyes.
    <br>His voice carried a hint of surrender.
    <br>As if to say he’d known it would end this way from the start.</p>
<p class="para">“If it’s Yonah’s wish, then there’s no way we could ever go against it.”</p>
<p class="para">It was time to go.
    <br>I took the Shadowlord’s hand and gave it a tug.</p>
<p class="para">“Let’s go together.”</p>
<p class="para">I didn’t know where we were headed.
    <br>I didn’t know where we were headed.
    <br>But I knew where we would arrive.
    <br>All we had to do was walk, without hesitation, into the darkness.</p>
<p class="para">Endless shadow.
    <br>There shouldn’t be anything there—
    <br>And yet I knew, without question, that there was a path waiting for us.</p>
<p class="para">A familiar voice echoed from beyond the darkness.</p>
<p class="para">“…Hurry the hell up and come back already, you—”</p>
<p class="para">I exchanged glances with the Shadowlord.
    <br>This was the way forward.
    <br>And it seemed someone was calling for us.
    <br>Someone with a foul mouth.</p>
<p class="para">I remembered who it was.
    <br>A precious companion of mine.</p>
<p class="para">“Sounds like we’d better hurry.”</p>
<p class="para">I murmured, and the Shadowlord nodded with a faint smile.</p>
<p class="para">And so, we began to walk.
    <br>Beyond this darkness lies a world where our friends are waiting.
    <br>Yes—a world I could never replace.</p>
