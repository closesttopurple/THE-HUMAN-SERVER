<p class="title">Chapter 2 - Record of Disposal</p>
<p class="para">Year 11945.<br>
    The long, long war between androids and machines was coming to its end.</p>
<p class="para">In a forest still bearing the scars of conflict, stood one <i>machine lifeform.</i>
    <br>Its large, bronze-colored body was supported by two legs. A cloth bag, stuffed with junk, hung from a mechanism mounted on its back.</p>
<p class="para">He looked up. The branches and leaves of the trees had been scorched away, leaving nothing to block the sky—yet strangely, the surroundings felt dim.
    <br>One especially massive trunk remained, barely clinging to the earth, though it showed no sign of ever turning green again.</p>
<p class="para">With a clunky metal arm, he reached out to touch the tree, and murmured:</p>
<p class="para">“Pascal... it’s too big of a space here to be alone, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="para">This was once the village built by a machine lifeform called <i>Pascal</i>. </p>
<p class="para">The machine lifeforms—built by aliens who had invaded Earth—and the <i>androids</i>, created by the humans who fled to the moon...</p>
<p class="para">These two lifeless factions had fought a bitter, evenly matched war for ages beyond measure.</p>
<p class="para">But amidst that endless strife, a machine lifeform emerged that dreamed of peace. That was <i>Pascal</i>. </p>
<p class="para">The village he founded came to be called <i>Pascal’s Village</i>, and it became a haven for other machines who likewise shunned war.</p>
<p class="para">But now, no signs of life remain.
    <br>The homes were gone, the residents long vanished.</p>
<p class="para">All that remained in this place were twisted flowers made of junk.</p>
<p class="para">Stalks made of shafts, leaves fashioned from scrap iron, and at the center of each bloom, a sphere of intricate construction, surrounded by petals of tiny gears.
    <br>These strange objects stood spaced evenly apart—not clustered together, nor swaying in the breeze—just cold and still, scattered across the scorched forest.</p>
<p class="para">The junk-bagged machine stepped away from the great tree and gently stroked one of the metal flowers. A grinding screech of steel-on-steel rang out.
    <br>The unpleasant sound only served to make the surrounding silence more stark.</p>
<p class="para">The cold touch of these machine-made blossoms, so similar to his own, did nothing to soothe his loneliness.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Clatter clatter.</i></p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, a sound broke the stillness.
    <br>The noise drew closer, step by step, until it came to a stop.</p>
<p class="para">Standing before him now was a small machine lifeform, its arms full of junk.
    <br>If it were human, it might be described as childlike. In halting, awkward speech, the little machine addressed him:</p>
<p class="para">“MISTER, I BROUGHT SOME, I BROUGHT SOME.”</p>
<p class="para">The childlike machine held out the junk to him.
    <br>He crouched down to meet its gaze and gently accepted the offering.</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, as always. With this, I can make more flowers.”</p>
<p class="para">No one else lived here now—only the machine with the junk-filled bag.
    <br>But this little one would always appear from somewhere, bringing him the materials he needed.</p>
<p class="para">He immediately began sorting through the parts. Anything useful was tucked into the cloth bag on his back.</p>
<p class="para">The childlike machine watched, then asked why he continued to make flowers.</p>
<p class="para">“Why…? I’m sorry. I don’t know myself. Not even about who I am…”</p>
<p class="para">The junk-bagged machine gave a troubled smile.</p>
<p class="para">He had no memory.
    <br>When he became aware, he’d been walking toward this village. Everything before that was a blank.</p>
<p class="para">And when he finally arrived, the first thing he saw was a broken-down village, littered with junk.</p>
<p class="para">He had no idea what had happened there.
    <br>But the mess made him uncomfortable, so he cleaned it up.</p>
<p class="para">Then, with the village now empty and hollow, it felt too lonely… so he began crafting machine flowers, hoping to add a touch of liveliness.</p>
<p class="para">Somehow, it just felt like he <i>should</i>.
    <br>Like he <i>had</i> to.</p>
<p class="para">But still, he didn’t know why. He couldn’t remember a thing.</p>
<p class="para">He confessed this to the childlike machine, and ended with:</p>
<p class="para">“Those who knew me before… they called me ‘Pascal’.” </p>
<p class="para">The little machine didn’t nod or respond, just quietly listened.
    <br>It was hard to say how much of the story it understood.</p>
<p class="para">“MAYBE,” it said,
    <br>“MISTER… MAYBE YOU USED TO LOVE FLOWERS.”</p>
<p class="para">The childlike machine went on to say that it would go pick flowers in a nearby canyon and bring them back as a gift.
    <br>Not machine-made flowers, but real, beautiful ones. Apparently, they were quite rare.</p>
<p class="para">But the junk-bagged machine could not bring himself to be happy.
    <br>He knew that canyon was the stronghold of armed androids.</p>
<p class="para">While the broader conflict between machine lifeforms and androids had settled into a tentative calm, not everyone welcomed peace.
    <br>There were still those who sought to rekindle the fires of war.
    <br>The androids known as <i>extremists</i> longed for the day they could wipe out the machine lifeforms in a single strike.</p>
<p class="para">The child didn’t seem to know this.
    <br>And so—he would have to tell them.</p>
<p class="para">Don’t go to the canyon.
    <br>Because...
    <br>Because that canyon is—</p>
<p class="para">He didn’t know.</p>
<p class="para">His thoughts stopped dead.</p>
<p class="para">The words he was supposed to say—none of them came.</p>
<p class="para">He couldn’t grasp what emotion lay waiting at the end of that canyon trail.
    <br>An emotion that any living being would instinctively understand.
    <br>An emotion even machines, designed in the image of life, were meant to have.</p>
<p class="para">But in its absence, an error occurred.
    <br>And he could no longer move.</p>
<p class="para">Yet the childlike machine lifeform noticed nothing strange.</p>
<p class="para">“WAIT HERE, OKAY? PROMISE! PROMISE!”</p>
<p class="para">Was that meant to be a pinky swear?
    <br>With rough, clunky digits that barely resembled fingers, the child pinched his hand.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Clink.</i></p>
<p class="para">He heard the soft metal sound and wanted to squeeze that hand back, to hold them there, to stop them from going.
    <br>But still—he couldn’t move.</p>
<p class="para">Not even words came.
    <br><i>Wait... please wait...</i>
    <br>Not even that.</p>
<p class="para">The shadow of the great tree stretched slowly across the ground.
    <br></p>
<p class="para">As if trying to reach toward the child’s retreating back in his place.</p>
<p class="para">But the shadow only lengthened and shrank again, circling helplessly over the earth.
    <br> All he could do was watch it drift past his body—and ask himself:</p>
<p class="para">“Pascal... why did you become me?”</p>
<p class="para">Pascal, who once ruled over this village.
    <br>Why had he lost his memory?</p>
<p class="para">It must have been something so terrible, so unbearable, that his memories had to be erased.
    <br>Something that perhaps connected to the devastation that had befallen this place.</p>
<p class="para">But even that line of thought was blocked.
    <br>Interrupted by the same error, born of something he no longer had: the emotions that were meant to guide him.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">By the time the great tree’s shadow had made its third full circle, the junk-bagged machine lifeform could finally move again.</p>
<p class="para">He resumed making flowers from scraps.
    <br>One by one, with deliberate care.
    <br>Even though he still didn’t understand what the act truly meant.</p>
<p class="para">The child who had gone to pick flowers had not yet returned.</p>
<p class="para">But he tried not to think about that.
    <br>No—perhaps it was more accurate to say that he <i>couldn’t</i> think about it.
    <br>The emotional void within him triggered errors if he so much as began.
    <br>And so, without realizing it, his thoughts quietly evicted the child from his mind.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, he stopped remembering them at all.</p>
<p class="para">While he was engrossed in his flower-making, footsteps echoed through the quiet forest.
    <br>But they did not belong to a machine lifeform.</p>
<p class="para">It was an android—a woman.</p>
<p class="para">She introduced herself as a member of the Resistance.
    <br>The Resistance—androids who operated from Earth, continuing their fight against the machine lifeforms.</p>
<p class="para">“Hello there,” said the junk-bagged machine.</p>
<p class="para">The Resistance android blinked, momentarily taken aback.</p>
<p class="para">“So the rumors were true. You really <i>are</i> a gentle machine.”</p>
<p class="para">At this time, the war between androids and machine lifeforms had settled into a temporary lull.
    <br>Still, it was rare for a machine to show no hostility—or even wariness—toward an android.</p>
<p class="para">That said, this wasn’t going to turn into a friendly chat.
    <br>The Resistance android got straight to the point.</p>
<p class="para">“We’ve received intel that the extremist androids nearby are preparing to rise up.
    <br>Even if they’re our own kind, we can’t allow them to disrupt the peace.
    <br>We’re going to strike before they make a move.”</p>
<p class="para">She had come to ask the junk-bagged machine lifeform for help.
    <br>Androids and machine lifeforms were natural enemies—she knew that as well as anyone.
    <br>But to stop further bloodshed, she was willing to join forces with anyone.</p>
<p class="para">That’s why she had come here—to the ruins of Pascal’s Village.
    <br>She’d heard of a machine lifeform who cherished peace.</p>
<p class="para">And now, seeing him for herself, she felt certain.
    <br>He showed no hostility, even toward her.</p>
<p class="para">Surely this one would lend his strength to their cause.</p>
<p class="para">And just as she’d hoped, the junk-bagged machine gave a quiet nod.</p>
<p class="para">“Understood.”</p>
<p class="para">He accepted her request, and even promised to reach out to other machine lifeforms in the area to ask for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="para">It was what Pascal would have done—or so he believed.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">The clash in the canyon near the ruins of Pascal’s Village—
    <br>A battle between the extremist androids and the united front of the Resistance and machine lifeforms—
    <br>Ended in victory for the Resistance and their mechanical allies.</p>
<p class="para">The junk-bagged machine lifeform had survived.
    <br>But that was likely because he had remained in the rear, providing support.
    <br>The battlefield was littered with the wreckage of both androids and machines, a silent testament to the brutality of the fight.</p>
<p class="para">He could do nothing but stare blankly at the lingering fires still smoldering across the area.</p>
<p class="para">Then, the android woman who had once approached him appeared again—
    <br>This time, supporting a badly wounded Resistance soldier on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="para">“If it had just been us, it would’ve been an even match.
    <br>What turned the tide was joining hands with your kind. We’re grateful.”</p>
<p class="para">To her gratitude, he offered only a short reply.</p>
<p class="para">“No, not at all.”</p>
<p class="para">It seemed a few of the extremist androids had managed to escape.
    <br>But they would likely be found before long—and eliminated.</p>
<p class="para">“Well then… keep up the good work.”</p>
<p class="para">With those parting words, he turned to leave.</p>
<p class="para">But after a step—then two—he stopped.
    <br>There, at his feet, was a small flower.</p>
<p class="para">It was no machine.
    <br>A real flower, in a rare and unusual shape.
    <br>Its reddish-purple petals flickered skyward like rising flames.</p>
<p class="para">And beside it…
    <br>He noticed a small piece of <i>junk</i> lying in the grass.</p>
<p class="para">He reached out, almost absentmindedly.
    <br>And when his fingers brushed the scrap, it gave off a faint—</p>
<p class="para"><i>Gi-gi-gi…</i></p>
<p class="para">—the sound of metal lightly scraping metal.</p>
<p class="para">He had heard that sound before.
    <br>The sound of fingers crossing in promise.
    <br>A sound tied to a memory he had forgotten.</p>
<p class="para">And now, in this moment, it returned.</p>
<p class="para">His legs gave out beneath him, and he collapsed to his knees.</p>
<p class="para">“So this is…”</p>
<img class="words">
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">Those were the feelings he had sealed away—
    <br>The pain he discarded to protect what remained of his heart,
    <br>forgotten alongside the abhorrent memories he could no longer bear to carry.</p>
<p class="para">A terror that he might have died in this battle as well—
    <br>And the despair of realizing the child's death—
    <br>They seized his frame and left him trembling.</p>
<p class="para">—Once, Pascal had taught emotions and knowledge to the machine children who lived alongside him.
    <br>He believed those things might serve a peaceful future—
    <br>for a village that rejected violence and embraced harmony.</p>
<p class="para">But one day, a catastrophic incident broke out in the village.
    <br>The machines ran amok, and as they witnessed their home reduced to rubble,
    the children were overwhelmed by the fear and despair Pascal had taught them.</p>
<p class="para">Unable to withstand those emotions, they took their own lives.</p>
<p class="para">And Pascal—
    <br>Broken by the loss, crushed by grief—
    <br>chose to delete his memories to survive.</p>
<p class="para">Those memories would never return to Pascal—
    <br>to the machine lifeform now wrapped in a bag of junk.</p>
<p class="para">But if they ever <i>did</i> come back—
    <br>he was certain he would not survive it.</p>
<p class="para">Returning to the village’s ruins, he began fashioning a small flower
    <br>from the remains of the child machine.
    <br>He modeled it after the fire-like blossom he had seen on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="para">And finally, he understood.</p>
<p class="para">The flowers he had been making all this time were offerings.
    <br>An act of mourning for the lost.
    <br>A forgotten version of himself—seeking atonement
    <br>for failing to protect the village he had once cherished.</p>
<p class="para">“Let this be the last flower.”</p>
<p class="para">And so, he made a decision.</p>
<p class="para">To once again call himself <i>Pascal—</i>
    <br>To carry on the will of his former self, who had once loved peace.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">Thanks to Pascal’s efforts, a ceasefire was formed between the android-led human army and the machine lifeforms who longed for peace.</p>
<p class="para">Fifteen years passed.</p>
<p class="para">Pascal stood in a bustling village.
    <br>It was filled with residents—some reading, others playing, others immersed in their own little joys.
    <br>Among them were both machine lifeforms and androids.
    <br>They lived together, hand in hand.</p>
<p class="para">The Village of Pascal had found a peace even greater than before its fall.
    <br>Even the once-scorched Great Tree was beginning to show green again with time.</p>
<p class="para">As Pascal quietly watched this scene, a group of machine children came running up to him.
    <br>One of them was holding a picture book—its cover cheerful and charming.</p>
<p class="para">“Uncle Pascal! What’s this ‘scary’ thing the book talks about?”</p>
<p class="para">The book was a replica of a story once made by humans.
    <br>A silly ghost story, meant to frighten.</p>
<p class="para">“That’s a feeling none of you need.”</p>
<p class="para">Pascal smiled gently—yet firmly—as he said it.</p>
<p class="para">And the children didn’t question his quiet rejection.</p>
<p class="para">“No scary things! No scary things!”</p>
<p class="para">They shouted joyfully and ran off, searching for the next game to play.</p>
<p class="para">After watching them go, Pascal left the village and made his way to a certain place—
    <br>the canyon where the battle between extremist androids and the Resistance once took place.</p>
<p class="para">Now, it was a dumping ground.
    <br>A graveyard of discarded remnants—
    <br>Extremist androids, berserk machines, every failed rebellion and failed ideology.</p>
<p class="para">Pascal took the picture book from earlier and cast it into the depths.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Thud</i>. A dry sound rang out.</p>
<p class="para">Severed android arms charred at the ends.
    <br>A machine head with its lights long gone, dark fluid leaking from its mouth.
    <br>A leg twisted in an unnatural angle.
    <br>Rust-bitten gears lying in decay.</p>
<p class="para">And atop them all,
    <br>the little ghost on the book’s cover smiled innocently.</p>
<p class="para">Pascal turned and walked away,
    <br>back toward the village.</p>
<p class="para">There, the junk-flowers he had once made still stood, unchanged.
    <br>Since the day he swore to make his final one, their number had not grown.</p>
<p class="para">“May those children live forever in happiness—
    <br>never knowing what fear is…”</p>
<p class="para">And today as well,
    <br>Pascal prayed to a single, small flower.</p>
<p class="para">“If it is to protect that future, then I will…”</p>
