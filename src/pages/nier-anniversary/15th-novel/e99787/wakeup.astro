<p class="para">DISCLAIMER 2: The webnovel does have background context for NieR Reincarnation and one of the chapters even takes place after its ending. It is strongly advised to read it all with Reincarnation context, though you can still enjoy it as a Replicant and Automata (and Drakengard) fan.</p>
<p class="para">A special original short novel written to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the NieR series.

<p class="para"><i>I awoke in the darkness, with no memories left—</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Not of who I was, nor of where I came from.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>In that void, I encountered a mysterious boy, cloaked in an otherworldly presence.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Drawn onward by his guidance, I began to walk once more.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>But what connection could our meeting possibly have…</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>to the world of NieR itself?</i></p>
<p class="title">Chapter 1 - Cage of Nothingness</p>
<p class="para">Like faint bubbles rising from the depths of the water, my consciousness gently floated to the surface.</p>
<p class="para">A world of darkness.</p>
<p class="para">In a silence as deep and endless as the void, I awoke.</p>
<p class="para">I seemed to be lying down. I braced my arms and pushed my upper body upright. Then, carefully, I rose to my feet.</p>
<p class="para">Where… is this place?
    <br>But more than that—</p>
<p class="para">—Who am <i>I</i>?</p>
<p class="para">I had no memory.
    <br>Not even a name came to mind. Naturally, I couldn’t recall why I was here, either.
    <br>I wasn’t even wearing any clothes. There wasn’t a single clue to tell me what kind of person I was.</p>
<p class="para">—I took a step forward.
    <br>A cool earthy sensation envelopes the soles of my feet, and I felt a slight resistance.
    <br>Despite this, I kept moving forward. Forward. Always forward.
    <br>Slowly, one step at a time. Not because I wanted to walk—there was simply nothing else I could do.</p>
<p class="para">A chill, like cold earth, pressed against the soles of my feet—just enough resistance to feel.</p>
<p class="para">But I kept moving. One step, then another. Forward. Always forward.</p>
<p class="para">Not because I <i>wanted</i> to walk. There was simply nothing else I <i>could</i> do.</p>
<p class="para">…How long had I been walking?</p>
<p class="para">A pale, blurry figure appeared ahead of me.</p>
<p class="para">Without hesitation, it began walking straight toward me.</p>
<p class="para">But how could it see me in this complete darkness, with no light anywhere?</p>
<p class="para">It seemed we were approaching one another.</p>
<p class="para">Maybe it was a mirror. That thought made a strange kind of sense.</p>
<p class="para">As we drew closer, the figure’s appearance came into clearer view.</p>
<p class="para">Long white hair, brushing near the eyes.</p>
<p class="para">A straight, elegant nose. Narrow, slanting eyes. Thin lips.</p>
<p class="para">The figure was a <i>boy</i>, with an air of quiet mystery about him.</p>
<p class="para">“So there you are,” he said. “When did you wake up?”</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, the boy spoke.</p>
<p class="para">What I’d thought was just my reflection in a mirror… turned out to be someone else entirely—a boy who stood apart from me.</p>
<p class="para">Without a word, he reached out and gently took my hand, the gesture ending up somewhere between a handshake and an awkward greeting.</p>
<p class="para">“Um… who are you?”</p>
<p class="para">I asked the question hesitantly, almost afraid of the answer.</p>
<p class="para">At my words, the boy gave a wry smile and let his shoulders drop.</p>
<p class="para">“Knew it. You’ve forgotten, haven’t you.”</p>
<p class="para">Forgotten…?</p>
<p class="para">So that meant—we knew each other?</p>
<p class="para">One question sparked another, and then another, my thoughts spinning out of control.</p>
<p class="para">Before I could ask anything else, the white-haired boy smiled brightly and gave my shoulders a few light pats.</p>
<p class="para">“All right. First things first—let’s get your memories back!”</p>
<p class="para">If he was offering to help me recover what I’d lost, I had no reason to say no.</p>
<p class="para">To meet someone kind in this world of darkness… maybe, in a strange way, I was lucky.</p>
<p class="para">“If you don’t get your memories back soon, your very existence will disappear.”</p>
<p class="para">—Disappear? My… existence?</p>
<p class="para">Why? How? What did that even mean?</p>
<p class="para">I must have been frozen there, mouth half-open, unable to respond.</p>
<p class="para">The boy chuckled at the sight and glanced around as if realizing something.</p>
<p class="para">“Ahaha… Well, I guess this place isn’t exactly the best spot for a chat, huh? A little too dark for that.”</p>
<p class="para">He turned, raised his right hand toward the empty air behind him, and snapped his fingers.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Snap!</i></p>
<p class="para">Light.</p>
<p class="para">The world flared into brightness so suddenly that I threw up my arms to shield my eyes.</p>
<p class="para">That vast, shadowed space we stood in had, with a single sound, been flooded with light.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re okay. Go on—open your eyes. Slowly.”</p>
<p class="para">Following the boy’s voice, I cautiously peeled my eyes open.</p>
<p class="para">Sunlight…</p>
<p class="para">I lowered the arms covering my face, slowly.</p>
<p class="para">And as my vision adjusted, little by little, I saw—</p>
<p class="para">A scene completely unlike anything I’d seen until now.</p>
<p class="para">It was a vast garden, overflowing with blooming flowers.</p>
<p class="para">We stood upon a path paved with brick.</p>
<p class="para">I was wearing white clothing—but I couldn’t quite tell what shape or style it was.</p>
<p class="para">When I looked at the boy, I saw he was dressed the same.</p>
<p class="para">It was like layers upon layers of sheer silk, garments so delicate they seemed almost like an optical illusion.</p>
<p class="para">On either side of us stretched vibrant flower beds, bursting with blossoms in a riot of color, each bloom vying for attention.</p>
<p class="para">Roses, lilies, gerberas, dahlias, daisies, fleabanes, anemones, marguerites, jackass clover…</p>
<p class="para">The boy pointed to each flower in turn, softly telling me their names.</p>
<p class="para">The garden was meticulously tended—the plants trimmed to uniform height.</p>
<p class="para">The cool sound of water trickled from a nearby fountain.</p>
<p class="para">The sky above was a flawless blue, not a single cloud in sight, and a gentle breeze brushed my cheeks.</p>
<p class="para">It felt impossible to believe that just moments ago, I had been trapped in a world of pure darkness.</p>
<p class="para">“…Can you use magic?”</p>
<p class="para">The question slipped out before I even realized I was speaking.</p>
<p class="para">It sounded foolish, but the boy burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="para">“I guess you could say that. Though, strictly speaking, it’s not my own power—it’s magic I gained through a <i>contract…</i>""</p>
<p class="para">His strange answer only deepened my confusion.</p>
<p class="para">“Let’s walk a little,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">He began strolling down the garden path, and I fell into step beside him.</p>
<p class="para">The garden was breathtaking.</p>
<p class="para">Flower beds arranged in perfect spacing, grouped by species.</p>
<p class="para">Not a single bloom was misshapen or wilted—every one flawless, like something out of a painting, too perfect to be real.</p>
<p class="para">It felt somehow familiar… and yet, at the same time, like a world I had never known.</p>
<p class="para">What kind of place had I come from, before losing my memories…?</p>
<p class="para">“Do you see that?” the boy suddenly said, pointing toward a flower bed where tall blossoms swayed.</p>
<p class="para">I narrowed my eyes and looked closely.</p>
<p class="para">Beneath the flowers, half-buried in the soil, was something that didn’t belong in a garden at all—a metal machine.</p>
<p class="para">It was about the size of a large satellite dish, big enough for an adult to carry with both arms.</p>
<p class="para">The round plate and the post supporting it…</p>
<p class="para">“I call it an <i>antenna</i>,” the boy said.</p>
<p class="para">And somehow, the sight sent a chill down my spine.</p>
<p class="para">The machine the boy had called an antenna was rusted over, vines wrapped tightly around it.</p>
<p class="para">As I looked around, I realized there were others—many of them—hidden throughout the garden.</p>
<p class="para">Some had become one with the roots of the flowers.</p>
<p class="para">Others were nearly swallowed by the soil.</p>
<p class="para">Inorganic beetles, mimicking life amidst the blossoms.</p>
<p class="para">That was the unsettling impression they gave me.</p>
<p class="para">“Any one of them is fine. Just pick one you like, and touch it.”</p>
<p class="para">The boy looked straight into my eyes.</p>
<p class="para">“If you do, you’ll be able to get your memories back.”</p>
<p class="para">What does that even mean…?</p>
<p class="para">But I sensed there was no point in asking further questions.</p>
<p class="para">Since waking in this world, not a single thing had made sense to me.</p>
<p class="para">The antennas were wrapped in thick vines, and didn’t look easy to reach.</p>
<p class="para">I crouched down in front of one of the flower beds.</p>
<p class="para">The warm, earthy scent of the soil filled my nose.</p>
<p class="para">Gently, I pushed aside the tough stems with my hands.</p>
<p class="para">Beneath them, half-buried in the dirt, lay a heavily rusted antenna.</p>
<p class="para">Still doubtful, I reached toward it.</p>
<p class="para">Touch this, and I’ll get my memories back? Really?</p>
<p class="para">“Whoa…!”</p>
<p class="para">The instant my fingers brushed the metal surface, something burst out from the antenna—a flood of light, or… no.</p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t light.</p>
<p class="para">It was words—a torrent of flowing text, rushing out as if it had been sealed inside.</p>
<p class="para">The characters poured into me, forcing their way between my thoughts and my body, splitting them apart…</p>
<p class="para">“Be safe now. Go on and search for it—the clue that will lead you to your memories…”</p>
<p class="para">And then—my consciousness was pulled under, into the world of words that overflowed from the antenna.</p>
