<p class="para"><i>I awoke in the darkness, with no memories left—</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Not of who I was, nor of where I came from.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>In that void, I encountered a mysterious boy, cloaked in an otherworldly presence.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>Drawn onward by his guidance, I began to walk once more.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>But what connection could our meeting possibly have…</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>to the world of NieR itself?</i></p>
<p class="title">Chapter 1 - Cage of Nothingness</p>
<p class="para">Like faint bubbles rising from the depths of water, the consciousness known as <i>me</i> gently rises to the surface.
<br>It was a world of darkness.</br>
<br>In a silence as deep and endless as the void, I awoke.</br></p>

<p class="para">I seemed to be lying down. I braced my arms and pushed my upper body upright. Then, carefully, I rose to my feet.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p class="para">Where… is this place?
    <br>But more than that—</p>
<p class="para">—Who am <i>I</i>?</p>
<p class="para">I had no memory.
    <br>Not even a name came to mind. Naturally, I couldn’t recall why I was here, either.
    <br>I wasn’t even wearing any clothes. There wasn’t a single clue to tell me what kind of person I was.</p>
<p class="para">—I took a step forward.
    <br>A cool earthy sensation envelopes the soles of my feet, and I felt a slight resistance.
    <br>Despite this, I kept moving forward. Forward. Always forward.
    <br>Slowly, one step at a time. Not because I wanted to walk—there was simply nothing else I could do.</p>
<p class="para">A chill, like cold earth, pressed against the soles of my feet—just enough resistance to feel.</p>
<p class="para">But I kept moving. One step, then another. Forward. Always forward.</p>
<p class="para">Not because I <i>wanted</i> to walk. There was simply nothing else I <i>could</i> do.</p>

<p class="para">…How long had I been walking?</p>

<p class="para">A faint white shadow came into view ahead.<br></br>
Without hesitation, it began walking straight toward me.<br></br>
But how could it see me in this complete darkness, with not a light to be found?</p>

<p class="para">We ended up approaching each other.<br></br>
Maybe…it was a mirror? That would explain things.<br></br>
As we drew closer, its appearance came into focus.</p>

<p class="para">Long strikingly white hair.<br></br>
A straight nose. Narrow, slanted eyes. Thin lips.<br></br>
The figure was that of a <i>boy</i>, cloaked in a mysterious aura.</p>

<p class="para">“So there you are. When did you wake up?”</p>

<p class="para">Suddenly, the boy spoke.<br></br>
The figure I thought was my reflection… turned out to be someone else entirely.<br></br>
The boy calmly took my hand, and we ended up in what resembled an awkward handshake.</p>

<p class="para">“Um… who are you?”</p>

<p class="para">I asked, cautiously.<br></br>
At my words, the boy gave a wry smile and let his shoulders drop.</p>

<p class="para">“So you have forgotten afterall.”</p>

<p class="para">Forgotten…?<br></br>
Then…does that mean we <i>knew</i> each other?<br></br>
One question after another bubbled up in my mind.</p>

<p class="para">Before I could say anything else, the white-haired boy smiled brightly and patted my shoulders.</p>

<p class="para">“Alright. First things first, let’s go get your memories back!”</p>

<p class="para">If he was offering to help me find my memories, there was no reason to refuse.<br></br>
To meet someone kind in this world of darkness, maybe I was lucky in a strange way.</p>

<p class="para">“If you don’t get your memories back soon, your very existence will disappear.”</p>

<p class="para">—Disappear? My… existence?<br></br>
What? Why? How?<br></br>
I couldn’t begin to understand.</p>

<p class="para">I must have been frozen there, mouth half-open, unable to respond.<br></br>
The boy chuckled at my reaction and looked around.</p>

<p class="para">“Ahaha… Well, I guess this place <i>isn’t</i> exactly the best spot for a chat, huh? A little too dark for that.”</p>

<p class="para">He turned around, raised his right hand toward the empty air, and snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class="para"><i>Snap!</i></p>

<p class="para">Light.<br></br>
Blinded by the sudden brightness, I shielded my face with my arms.<br></br>
The world that had been swallowed in darkness was instantly filled with light at the sound of that snap.</p>

<p class="para">“It’s alright. Go on, open your eyes. Slowly.”</p>

<p class="para">Following the boy’s voice, I cautiously peeled my eyes open.</p>

<p class="para">Sunlight…<br></br>
I lowered my arms from my face.<br></br>
As my vision adjusted to the light, a completely different scene spread out before me.</p>

<p class="para">A vast garden, overflowing with blooming flowers.<br></br>
We stood on a brick-paved path.<br></br>
I was wearing white clothing, but I couldn’t tell what kind of garment it was.<br></br>
Looking at the boy, I saw he was dressed the same. Like layers upon layers of translucent robes—an outfit that almost seemed like an optical illusion.<br></br>
On either side of us stretched vibrant flower beds, bursting with blossoms in a riot of color, each bloom vying for attention.<br></br>
Roses, lilies, gerberas, dahlias, daisies, halzions, anemones, marguerites, jackass clovers…<br></br>
The boy pointed at each flower one by one, and softly taught me their names.</p>

<p class="para">Neatly trimmed hedges.<br></br>
The cooling sound of water from a fountain.<br></br>
A cloudless sky and a breeze brushing gently against my cheek.<br></br>
The empty world from before felt like a distant lie.</p>

<p class="para">“You…can use <i>magic</i>?”</p>

<p class="para">The foolish question slipped from my lips.<br></br>
The boy burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="para">“You could say that. Though, I didn’t originally have it; it’s magic I gained through a <i>contract</i>…”</p>

<p class="para">That strange answer only raised more questions.</p>

<p class="para">“Let’s take a walk.”</p>

<p class="para">He began walking down the garden path, and I fell into step beside him.</p>

<p class="para">The garden was breathtaking.<br></br>
Various flower beds were arranged at even intervals, and not a single bloom looked wilted or misshapen.<br></br>
Everywhere I looked, it was flawless—like a painting crafted to be admired.</p>

<p class="para">It felt nostalgic, and yet… I had no memory of a place like this.<br></br>
What kind of place had I lived in before losing my memories…?</p>

<p class="para">“Do you see it? That thing over there.”</p>

<p class="para">The boy suddenly spoke, pointing toward a flower bed filled with tall blossoms.</p>

<p class="para">Squinting in the direction he pointed, I noticed a metallic object buried in the soil—something completely out of place in this garden.<br></br>
It was a disk, large enough that an adult would need both arms to carry it.<br></br>
A plate-like disk with a pillar to support it…</p>

<p class="para">“I call it an <i>antenna</i>,” the boy said.</p>

<p class="para">The antenna, as the boy referred to it, was rusted and entwined with vines.<br></br>
Looking around, I realized there were several others like it hidden throughout the garden.<br></br>
Some had fused with flower roots; others were nearly buried in the earth.<br></br>
They were like inorganic beetles, camouflaged among the blossoms.<br></br>
That was the unsettling impression they gave me.</p>

<p class="para">“Any one is fine. Pick whichever you like and touch it,”<br></br>
the boy said, gazing straight into my eyes.<br></br>
“If you do, you’ll be able to get your memories back.”</p>

<p class="para">What did that mean…?</p>

<p class="para">Still, asking more questions now wouldn’t help.<br></br>
Since waking up in this world, not a single thing has made sense to me.</p>

<p class="para">The antennas were wrapped in thick vines, and didn’t look easy to reach.<br></br>
I crouched down in front of one of the flower beds.<br></br>
The warm, earthy scent of the soil filled my nose.<br></br>
Gently, I pushed aside the tough stems with my hands.<br></br>
A rusted antenna, half-buried in the soil, emerged.<br></br>
I reached out my hand, half-convinced.<br></br>
If I touch this, will I really get my memories back?</p>

<p class="para">“Whoa…!”</p>

<p class="para">The instant my fingertip touched the metal, some kind of light burst out of the antenna.<br></br>
Light—no, it was a torrent of flowing words.</p>

<p class="para">The words poured into me, as if splitting apart my mind and body…</p>

<p class="para">“Off you go. Go on and search for it—the clues that will lead you to your memories…”</p>

<p class="para">And then…<br></br>
My consciousness was pulled under—<br></br>
pulled into the world of words that overflowed from the antenna—</p>
