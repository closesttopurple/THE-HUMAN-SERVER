<p class="title">Chapter 5 - Wind of Calamity</p>
<p class="para">With a blinding light, my consciousness drifts back, as if floating. I find myself once again pulled back to the place I started.</p>
<p class="para">Beneath a tree draped in pale violet flowers, hanging like curtains.
    <br>This is the same flower-filled garden as before—a place I travel through alongside the boy, searching for the memories I’ve lost.</p>
<p class="para">I recall the vision that surged into me the moment I touched the antenna buried at the base of the tree.
    <br>Girls setting out on a journey in search of a long-lost friend.
    <br>Just like the world they longed for, I wanted to live alongside Yonah.
    <br>And not just Yonah—</p>
<p class="para">"I wanted to live with those who were dear to me, too..."</p>
<p class="para">Memories of my companions begin to return.
    <br>I can’t remember their faces or names.
    <br> But somewhere deep in my heart, the memories of being with them remain—tugging at me, precious somehow.
    <br> A cottage on the edge of a village clinging to a cliffside.
    <br> A grand, Western-style mansion with an eerie presence.
    <br> The road we walked together. The idle chatter we shared.
    <br> At the same time, something about it feels like a past I never want to return to, and I sense a growing unrest within me.
    <br> Battles and farewells. Pain and loss clawing their way up from the depths of my soul.</p>
<p class="para">I loved them. But I’m afraid.
    <br>It hurts. I hate it. I want to run. I want to run. I want to run. I'm scared.
    <br>The closer I get to my own memories, the more I’m torn—part of me wants them back, part of me doesn’t. The contradiction is paralyzing.
    <br>Without thinking, I press a hand to my chest, as if trying to calm the sudden, violent pounding of my heart.</p>
<p class="para">"You were carrying too much."
    <br>The white-haired boy stands behind me.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Fsshhhhhh...</i></p>
<p class="para">A strong wind sweeps through the trees and flowers.|
    <br>The rustling leaves echo far into the distance.</p>
<p class="para">"I..."</p>
<p class="para">I speak without thinking, letting the words come. But I can’t go on.
    <br>If I say it, I’ll remember something. And that thought terrifies me.
    <br>If I remember—what will happen to me?
    <br>Is it wrong to stay as I am now?</p>
<p class="para"><i>FSSHHHHHHHH...</i></p>
<p class="para">Another gust tears through, passing between me and the boy.
    <br>The sound stirs a deep, aching loneliness.
    <br>Petals scatter.
    <br>As if the sun had been hidden by a passing cloud, a pale shadow falls over the place where we stand.</p>
<p class="para">As I brush the windblown hair from my eyes, I realize the garden has changed.
    <br>The once-vibrant flowers that basked in the light now droop toward the ground, withered.
    <br>The trees have shed their leaves, and every plant’s stem is bristling with sharp thorns.
    <br>The pale violet blossoms that once hung above are dry and lifeless now, looming over me with a silent menace.
    <br>The wind only grows stronger. In the distance, thunder begins to rumble.
    <br>A filthy storm of withered petals falls on me without mercy.</p>
<p class="para">"Why..."</p>
<p class="para">I turn to face the boy.
    <br>He meets my eyes at the exact same height.</p>
<p class="para">"Why do you have the same face as me?"</p>
<p class="para">I remembered my own face.
    <br>When I first awoke in this world and met the boy in the darkness, I’d mistaken him for my reflection in a mirror. It must have been because some part of me still remembered what I looked like, buried deep in my memory.
    <br>This white-haired boy—he looked exactly like me.</p>
<p class="para">"Who... are you?"</p>
<p class="para">He didn’t answer.</p>
<p class="para">"This way."</p>
<p class="para">Without responding to my question, the boy turned his back to me and began to walk.</p>
<p class="para">He moved quickly through the lifeless, gloomy garden.
    <br>Not wanting to be left behind, I hurried after him.
    <br>Unlike the world I had seen before, this place was miserable—so wretched it hurt to look at—and we passed through it in silence.</p>
<p class="para">The boy stepped without hesitation into a wide, circular flower bed, trampled across withered flowers beneath his feet as he walked straight through.
    <br>I knew the name of the flowers growing here, larger than any we’d passed.
    <br><i>Moon flowers.</i>
    <br>They were shriveled now, so their color was lost.
    <br>Every one of the broad blossoms drooped downward, and together they looked like a crowd of bowed infants. It was deeply unsettling.
    <br>I tried to follow without stepping on them, but it was impossible. Eventually, I gave up.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Kyuu, kyuu...</i></p>
<p class="para">The moon flowers gave off a squealing sound underfoot, as though screeching in pain.</p>
<p class="para">The boy stopped at the center of the circular bed.
    <br>There, layers of browned, dying moon flowers were piled atop one another, hiding something beneath.
    <br>I felt a chill run through me, as if the flowers themselves had a will of their own.</p>
<p class="para">"If you touch this antenna, everything will become clear."</p>
<p class="para">Though his face showed no emotion, his voice carried a force that was impossible to resist.
    <br>Was it anger? Or sadness?
    <br>It could have been either—or neither.
    <br>Suddenly, I felt the urge to run.
    <br>But there was nowhere to go.
    <br>Unless I recovered my memories, my very self would disappear.
    <br>And more than anything, I had to see Yonah again.
    <br>Only that vague, unshaped memory kept me moving.</p>
<p class="para">I knelt before the mass of moon flowers.
    <br>Pushing through layer after layer of petals and stems, I reached out, searching for the familiar touch of metal.</p>
<p class="para">The moment my fingers brushed the antenna—
    <br>A rush of glowing symbols burst out from it, wrapping around me like light unleashed.</p>
<p class="para">I was terrified of what might be waiting beyond this point.
    <br>But I knew—I could never turn back now.</p>
