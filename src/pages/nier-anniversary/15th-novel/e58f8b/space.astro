<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fyyNmAz.jpeg">
<p class="para"><i>A world of pure white sand that stretches to the horizon. Lying in the sand are broken cars and towers of bones.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>To the eyes of the girls wandering the desert, these things appeared like a distant dream swept away by wind and sand.</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>The purpose of their journey? It was a precious friend who had been lost...</i>
    <br>A world of pure white sand, stretching on beyond the horizon.
    <br>In the hollow emptiness of the desert, two girls walked.</p>
<p class="para">Scattered throughout the sand lie the remnants of a lost civilization.
    <br>Broken cars. Severed railway tracks. The remains of towers rising like bone.
    <br>They were said to be the traces of people who had once lived long, long ago, but to the girls’ eyes, they seemed nothing more than a distant dream, swept away by wind and sand.</p>
<p class="para">A distant dream.
    <br>Fio—the girl with braided hair—recalled something faint and nostalgic through the haze of heat clouding her thoughts.
    <br>Back before she had come to Earth, when she was in that place called the “Cage.”</p>
<p class="para">The Cage—
    <br>A stone tower rising within a digital world, inside a server installed on the surface of the moon.
    <br>It was a place created to preserve the memories of humankind, now long extinct.</p>
<p class="para">It was there, lost in the Cage, that Fio met a monster named Levania.
    <br>A precious friend, who had saved her from loneliness.
    <br>Together with him, Fio journeyed through the Cage, discovering countless worlds recorded there, and the countless wishes woven within them.</p>
<p class="para">And at the end of that journey, she met the white-haired girl now walking ahead of her.
    <br>That girl had lost someone dear, left all alone—and Fio had wanted to stay by her side. </p>
<p class="para">So, from the moon to the Earth.
    <br>Fio chose to part from Levania, and came to this world.</p>
<p class="para">And now, the reason the two of them are crossing the white desert together—is to search for the friend the white-haired girl had lost.
    <br>This journey was Fio’s idea.</p>
<p class="para">But the journey was far harder than she’d expected.
    <br>The relentless sun sapped her strength, little by little. And without noticing how Fio was falling behind, the white-haired girl pressed steadily on ahead. </p>
<p class="para">“Hey, Kano-chan…”</p>
<p class="para">Fio called out to the back walking ahead of her.
    <br>Kano-chan.
    <br>That was the nickname Fio used for the white-haired girl.
    <br>Once, a boy who had called himself <i>He</i> had called this girl “Kanojo” (meaning "She" or "Her").
    <br>So, from <i>Kanojo</i> came <i>Kano-chan.</i></p>
<p class="para">"Do you think we could take a little break?"</p>
<p class="para">When Fio said that, she stopped walking and quickly turned around.
    <br>“…Alright.”</p>
<p class="para">The moment the words left her mouth, her gaze drifted—slipping past Fio and shifting off into the distance.
    <br>“What’s that…?”</p>
<p class="para">Fio followed her eyes.
    <br>Out in the white desert, a solitary black dot.
    <br>It was moving toward them, accompanied by a deep, mechanical roar—<i>goon, goon</i>—growing louder with each passing second.
    <br>It looked like a massive black box.</p>
<p class="para">“We should run…!”</p>
<p class="para">A terrible feeling welled up in Fio’s chest. She grabbed <i>her</i> hand and bolted.
    <br>But the sand made it hard to run—every step was heavy, their feet sinking with each stride.
    <br>They weaved a desperate zigzag across the dunes, and the black box thundered after them.</p>
<p class="para">They ran and ran.
    <br>Then, in the distance, they spotted something—thick pipes jutting from the sand and stretching far across the landscape.
    <br>It looked more solid than sand, like it might be easier to run across.
    <br>With a shared glance, they adjusted their steps and leapt up onto the pipe.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Gogogo…</i></p>
<p class="para">With a dull metallic thud, the pipe suddenly lifted high into the air.
    <br>The two girls screamed as they lost their balance, clinging desperately to the surface so they wouldn’t be thrown off.</p>
<p class="para">What they had thought was a pipe—
    <br>Was actually a weapon left behind by the aliens that once invaded the Earth:
    <br>A <i>machine lifeform.</i></p>
<p class="para">The ground shook violently. Clouds of dust erupted into the air.
    <br>The machine lifeform slithered forward across the desert, its long, snake-like body writhing as it moved.
    <br><i>—Her</i> hand slipped.
    <br>Before <i>She</i> could even cry out, her body was flung into the air.
    <br>Fio threw herself forward on reflex, reaching out toward the girl.
    <br>Their hands met, their arms wrapped around each other—
    <br>And with a heavy thud, the two of them tumbled across the sand.</p>
<p class="para">The gaze of the snake-like machine lifeform turned toward them.
    <br>It felt like they were done for and that there was no escape.</p>
<p class="para">But just then, a deafening sound rang out.
    <br>The black box slammed into the machine lifeform at full speed.
    <br>The impact sent the massive body rolling across the sand.
    <br>After tumbling a fair distance, the machine lifeform—perhaps out of fear—burrowed into the sand and vanished from sight.</p>
<p class="para">Saved…?</p>
<p class="para">The moment they felt relief,
    <br>The roar of the black box reemerged from beyond the dust cloud.
    <br>It came to a stop, perfectly, before the two girls.
    <br>From the black box stepped… the <i>machine lifeform.</i></p>
<p class="para">But it was not the terrifying, snake-like giant from before.
    <br>It looked more like a metal doll, smaller even than Fio.</p>
<p class="para">“I DID NOT MEAN TO STARTLE YOU. PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES.”</p>
<p class="para">The machine lifeform bowed deeply as it spoke.
    <br>Fio and the girl couldn’t help but feel completely caught off guard.</p>
<p class="para">Though Machine Lifeforms had once fought a brutal war against humanity’s armies, it seemed that not all of them continued to function purely as weapons.
    <br>This particular one, as it explained, had been collecting human relics, loading them into the black vehicle—a trailer—and transporting them back to its base.
    <br>It had only chased after the girls to warn them of the approaching danger of the giant machine lifeform.</p>
<p class="para">“Wait… then maybe…!”</p>
<p class="para">Fio suddenly spoke up.
    <br>If this machine lifeform was collecting relics of humanity, then maybe… maybe it knew something about the friend they were searching for.</p>
<p class="para">“…I AM SORRY. I DO NOT POSSESS SUCH INFORMATION.”
    <br>Fio looked down, visibly disappointed.
    <br>But the Machine Lifeform continued.
    <br>There were many relics stored at its base, it said. Perhaps among them, a clue might be found—something that could lead them to the friend they sought.</p>
<p class="para">A small light flickered in Fio’s eyes.
    <br>“Then maybe we really can find your friend, Kano-chan!”
    <br>Bright with hope, she jumped up onto the trailer bed, excitement brimming in her heart.
    <br>But the white-haired girl—<i>She</i>—watched her from below, a different emotion stirring within her chest.</p>
<p class="para">—Because deep down, she already knew.
    <br>No matter how far they searched, they would never find <i>Him</i> again.
    <br>Because <i>she</i> had seen it—<i>His</i> final moments, with her own eyes.
    <br>But she couldn’t tell Fio that.
    <br>She couldn’t bring herself to say, “He’s gone.”
    <br>She didn’t know what kind of face she’d make if she tried to put that into words.</p>
<p class="para">Fio had left behind her own precious friend—Levania—to come to Earth and be with her.
    <br>After all that, how could she possibly show her sadness?
    <br>How could she burden Fio with that?</p>
<p class="para">The trailer’s engine roared to life, its wheels kicking up clouds of sand.
    <br>Across the pure white desert, a straight pair of tire tracks stretched out behind them.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">Rocking gently with the motion of the trailer, the two girls eventually arrived at a massive structure standing alone in the middle of the desert.
    <br>Its silver walls shimmered under the sunlight, gleaming brightly.
    <br>Its shape resembled that of a ship—like a wrecked vessel run aground, left stranded in the sand.</p>
<p class="para">Led by the machine lifeform, they stepped inside and were greeted by rows upon rows of objects they had never seen before.
    <br>Strange machines encased in transparent boxes.
    <br>A massive painting of stars hung on the wall.
    <br>Fio looked around in wonder.</p>
<p class="para">“What is this place…?”
    <br>“A science museum. It displays all kinds of things humanity once studied… like outer space.”
    <br>The answer came from <i>Her</i>.
    <br>Having once served the task of observing humanity’s memories, She often found herself explaining things Fio didn’t know.
    <br>“Outer space?”
    <br>Fio tilted her head with the question.
    <br>It wasn’t surprising that she didn’t know—the place she came from hadn’t exactly offered a conventional education.
    <br>She explained that outer space was a faraway place beyond Earth, where the moon and stars would shine.</p>
<p class="para">“Then… I guess I came from space too,” Fio said.</p>
<p class="para">At those words, something tightened sharply in <i>her</i> chest.
    <br><i>She</i> had never stopped regretting letting Fio choose to come to Earth—to leave everything behind.
    <br>Shaking off the feelings that had begun to surface, <i>She</i> glanced around.
    <br>Before they knew it, the machine lifeform had moved on ahead without them. But Fio remained absorbed by the exhibits.</p>
<p class="para">“Come on, Kano-chan! Let’s go see the rest!”</p>
<p class="para">Grabbing <i>her</i> hand, Fio dashed deeper into the museum.
    <br>Rockets, artificial satellites, enormous antennas, astronomical telescopes, meteor fragments…
    <br>“What’s that?” “What’s this?”</p>
<p class="para">With every question Fio asked, <i>She</i> answered carefully, one by one.
    <br>Her voice was starting to go hoarse—but when Fio beamed and said, “Kano-chan, you know everything!” it somehow didn’t feel so bad.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, they arrived at a dome-shaped room.
    <br>There were no windows, and the only light came from the doorway left open behind them—and from the glow of the machine lifeform’s eyes, who had arrived just before them.</p>
<p class="para">“THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE.”</p>
<p class="para">As their eyes adjusted to the dark, they began to make out the room’s features.
    <br>In the center stood a curious machine, surrounded by countless seats.
    <br>Fio tilted her head, puzzled, and She explained: this was called a planetarium.
    <br>And then the two of them noticed—
    <br>Seated in one of the chairs was a machine lifeform, nearly identical to the one that had guided them here.
    <br>But this one… wasn’t moving.</p>
<p class="para">“Who is this…?” Fio asked.</p>
<p class="para">He began to speak.
    <br>It no longer moved, but—
    <br>This was his dearest friend.
    <br>Long ago, the two of them had wandered the desert without a destination, until they stumbled upon this science museum.
    <br>As they came to understand that it was a “monument to human knowledge,” they found themselves dreaming of the stars.</p>
<p class="para">Of all the exhibits, this planetarium had captivated them the most.
    <br>According to the manual, the projector at the center could cast a brilliant night sky upon the domed ceiling.
    <br>But by the time they had arrived, the machine was already broken.
    <br>They tried to fix it, but never figured out how.
    <br>Time passed.
    <br>Then, fifteen years ago—
    <br>His friend’s core failed.
    <br>He would never move again.</p>
<p class="para">“I DON’T KNOW WHEN I’LL BREAK TOO…”</p>
<p class="para">Before that day came, he wanted to fulfill the dream they had shared.
    <br>One day, no matter what, he would light up the planetarium with stars.
    <br>That was his vow.</p>
<p class="para">“…Hey. This… planetarium. Do you think we could all fix it together?”
    <br>Fio spoke softly, gazing at the broken projector.</p>
<p class="para">The sorrow of losing a precious friend.
    <br>The dream he once shared with that friend.
    <br><i>She</i> thought that Fio must have felt those things as if they were her own. Fio had always been that kind of person—someone who carried not just her own pain, but others’ as well. </p>
<p class="para">If <i>She</i> helped repair the planetarium, perhaps she could carry part of that sorrow with Fio—
    <br>Perhaps it would be a way to atone for the guilt of having made her leave Levania behind…
    <br>With those thoughts in her mind, <i>She</i> nodded and accepted Fio’s proposal.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">Using the memories of humanity she once observed, she devised a method to repair the planetarium’s projector.
    <br>First, she restored the lighting to brighten the dark room for work. Then, under her guidance, the three of them gathered usable parts from the exhibits and the supplies that had been transported in, fumbling their way through the repairs together.
    <br>Now, the three of them were exploring the science museum in search of a lens—one essential for projecting stars.
    <br>“Ah! That one!”
    <br>Fio’s eyes sparkled as she pointed upward. Suspended from the ceiling was a model of an artificial satellite, and mounted to it, glinting in the light, was a camera lens.
    <br>But no matter how much any of them stretched, they couldn’t reach it. The machine lifeform slumped in disappointment—until Fio gently called out to him.</p>
<p class="para">“Leave it to me!”</p>
<p class="para">She clambered up a nearby parabolic antenna on display, then leapt toward the satellite model. With nimble hands, she removed the lens—
    <br>—but the next moment, her small body was airborne. Before the others could even shout, Fio hit the floor with a dull thud.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you okay?!”</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i> rushed to Fio’s side.</p>
<p class="para">“Hehe… I’m fine!”</p>
<p class="para">Fio sat up, looking a little embarrassed. Even after that fall from such a height, she still held the lens tightly in her hand. That earnest grip made <i>Her’s</i> chest ache.</p>
<p class="para">“…I keep making you push yourself...”</p>
<p class="para">A swell of guilt welled up in her heart.
    <br>She hadn’t realized how exhausted Fio was in the desert, dragging her along anyway. She was the one who said the projector could be fixed, yet couldn’t even gather parts on her own.</p>
<p class="para">And worst of all—
    <br>She had made Fio come to Earth.
    <br>Had forced her to leave behind her dearest friend.</p>
<p class="para">As <i>she</i> struggled to find words to begin, Fio spoke first.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not pushing myself. I’m sorry for worrying you.”</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i> was always teaching Fio new things.
    <br>That was why, when they were together, Fio could see a world she never would’ve glimpsed on her own.
    <br>It made her so happy—so excited.
    <br>That’s why, she said, she wasn’t pushing herself at all.
    <br>Fio smiled gently.</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i> still didn’t fully know how to face Fio. But she knew one thing for certain: those words weren’t a lie. Because she’d learned, again and again, just how incapable Fio was of lying. How honest and pure she truly was.</p>
<p class="para">And so the repairs continued. They failed again and again, encouraging one another each time.
    <br>But despite scouring the museum, they were still short of one critical lens. The satellite camera, the junk the machine lifeform had collected—everything usable had already been used.</p>
<p class="para">As the two girls exchanged troubled glances—</p>
<p class="para">“IF IT’S A LENS… YOU CAN… USE OURS…”</p>
<p class="para">The Machine Lifeform suggested using the lenses from his own eye—and the eye of his unmoving friend.</p>
<p class="para">Fio and <i>she</i> were stunned. They rushed to stop him.
    <br>Even if this was the only way to complete the projector, there was no need to sacrifice any part of himself.</p>
<p class="para">But he had a reason for rushing—
    <br>A reason to finish while he still could.</p>
<p class="para">“I DON’T KNOW… HOW MUCH LONGER I’LL MOVE…”</p>
<p class="para">He looked toward his friend, still seated in the planetarium’s chair, staring silently up at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="para">“DON’T WORRY… IF IT WERE HIM… HE’D… WANT THIS TOO…”</p>
<p class="para">There was a deep, unwavering resolve in his voice.
    <br>Fio and <i>she</i> exchanged a glance… and quietly nodded.</p>
<p class="para">Those lenses had witnessed so much.
    <br>From long ago—back when they were weapons made to fight humanity—they had seen the world through countless years.
    <br>Scratched and worn by time, the lenses were gently removed and given a new purpose: to gaze upon the stars, not from their bodies, but from within the projector they’d worked so hard to build.</p>
<p class="para">The universe they had longed for.</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i> carefully removed the lenses from the two friends.
    <br>Fio polished them with utmost care.
    <br>It felt like a prayer.</p>
<p class="para">Once the lenses were in place, <i>she</i> finished the final adjustments.</p>
<p class="para">The projector they’d built together—Fio, <i>she</i>, and the Machine Lifeform—was a little rough around the edges, but there it stood: a real, completed planetarium projector.</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i>, Fio, the broken Machine Lifeform, and his friend all sat side-by-side in the rows of seats, gazing up at the stars.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s beautiful…!”</p>
<p class="para">Stars blossomed across the dome.
    <br>Countless lights twinkled against the dark sky.
    <br>The moon slowly rose, casting a soft silver glow over them all.</p>
<p class="para">“THIS IS… SPACE… IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL… I’M… SO HAPPY…”</p>
<p class="para">The Machine Lifeform spoke as if sharing the moment with his friend.
    <br>Beside him, Fio turned to look at <i>her</i>.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s all thanks to you, Kano-chan. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="para">Fio’s eyes sparkled brighter than any star in the sky.
    <br>And seeing that, <i>she</i> smiled softly in return.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">The stars revolving slowly on the ceiling came to a sudden halt.
    <br>“Huh?” Fio murmured, just as a woman’s voice rang out through the room.</p>
<p class="para">Startled, Fio and the Machine Lifeform turned toward the source—but <i>she</i> explained that this was part of the planetarium’s features, something called a “narration,” used to teach visitors about the stars.</p>
<p class="para">And so, the three of them sat quietly, listening to the voice.</p>
<p class="para">—Since ancient times, humanity has longed for the distant stars that glimmer in the night sky.
    <br>And so, when civilization became aware of the universe, it was only natural that people dreamed of venturing beyond the Earth.</p>
<p class="para">The first destination: the Moon.
    <br>The closest star, drawn to Earth by gravity, always shining nearby.</p>
<p class="para">Thus, humanity began striving toward the Moon through various means.
    <br>Among them was a mission known as the “Apollo Program”...</p>
<p class="para">“I wonder,” Fio said softly, “what did everyone want to do once they reached space?”</p>
<p class="para">It was always <i>her</i> role to answer those kinds of questions.
    <br><i>She</i> sifted through countless possible answers in her mind… and then chose the one that felt right for Fio.</p>
<p class="para">“I think… people wanted to <i>tell</i> someone. To share all the memories they’d made on Earth—with someone who might be out there in the stars.”</p>
<p class="para">As the narration ended, the stars of the planetarium began to move once more.
    <br>Like a stopped clock ticking to life again, the lights of the night sky traced arcs across the dome, flowing gently overhead.</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i> realized, in that moment, that she could finally say what she’d long wanted to say.</p>
<p class="para">“…Fio—let’s go. Let’s try to find a way to meet Levania again. Together.”</p>
<p class="para">It had been her fault, she thought. That Fio and Levania had been separated.
    <br>It was for her sake that Fio continued to search for someone she might never see again.</p>
<p class="para">And she had always felt guilty for that.</p>
<p class="para">But now, <i>She</i> could believe in something else:
    <br>Fio hadn’t left Levania behind out of despair—she had come to Earth out of hope.
    <br>She had taken <i>her</i> hand, when she had no one else.</p>
<p class="para">Then what <i>She</i> needed to do… was not to dwell in guilt.
    <br>It was to do for Fio what Fio had done for her: offer hope.</p>
<p class="para">“…Thank you, Kano-chan.”</p>
<p class="para">Fio smiled as she said it—but tears rolled silently down her cheeks.
    <br>They were emotions she had locked away for a long, long time.</p>
<p class="para">She had always smiled. Always tried to stay strong.
    <br>But the truth was—</p>
<p class="para">“I... didn’t think I’d ever see Kaibutsu-san (Monster) again.”</p>
<p class="para">Her tears sparkled beneath the light of the stars.
    <br>And seeing them, <i>she</i> finally understood.
    <br>That aching loss—that sorrow of believing you'd never see someone precious again…They had been carrying the same thing.</p>
<p class="para">She had never truly been alone.</p>
<p class="para"><i>She</i> gently drew Fio into an embrace.
    <br>And between them, no more words were needed.
    <br>They wiped each other’s tears, and laughed through them.
    <br>Above, the stars of the planetarium sparkled as if to bless their feelings.</p>
<p class="para">And so, once they confirmed that the projector had fully recovered, the two girls left the science museum behind.</p>
<p class="para">“THANK YOU,” the Machine Lifeform repeated over and over as they said goodbye.</p>
<p class="para">He said he would stay there, with his broken friend, and continue to keep watch over the place.
    <br>And from now on, he would learn more about space.</p>
<p class="para">He wanted to go to space with his friend someday.
    <br>It was a dream he’d given up on without realizing it, thinking he might stop functioning at any moment—just like his companion.</p>
<p class="para">But watching Fio and <i>her</i> repair the projector—something that had seemed impossible—he realized that perhaps, he still had things he could do too.</p>
<p class="para"><i>We’ll see each other again someday, I’m sure.</i>
    <br>That’s what Fio and <i>she</i> told him.</p>
<p class="para">For they too had chosen to embark on a new journey—to search for a way to reach space.</p>
<p class="para">Space. The Moon.
    <br>The very first destination humanity had ever aimed for.</p>
<p class="para">Fio and Levania had once lived in a place called the "Cage"—on the surface of the Moon.
    <br>So maybe, if they reached the Moon, they could see him again. </p>
<p class="para">Friends are like two stars, drawn together by gravity. Like the Earth and the Moon.</p>
<p class="para">It would be alright.
    <br>Humanity had reached the Moon with the Apollo spacecraft.
    <br>Then surely, they could too.</p>
<p class="para">And so, the two girls walked once more across the white desert.</p>
<p class="para">Along the way, <i>She</i> reached into her pocket and pulled out something small.
    <br>A memento the Machine Lifeform had given her.</p>
<p class="para">“Hey, this… is for you.”</p>
<p class="para">Resting in her open hand were two shimmering, star-shaped rings.
    <br>They looked like toys—childish things made for play.
    <br>She took one of them and gently slid it onto Fio’s finger.</p>
<p class="para">Fio let out a delighted gasp. “Wow!”</p>
<p class="para">Then <i>she</i> looked straight into Fio’s eyes and said, softly but clearly—</p>
<p class="para">“I want to be…your friend.”</p>
<p class="para">Fio blinked in surprise. And then beamed.</p>
<p class="para">“Me too! Let’s be friends!”</p>
<p class="para">And with that, the two girls began to walk again.
    <br>The wind kicked up a soft swirl of sand behind them, wiping away their footprints—
    <br>As though seeing them off on the beginning of a new journey.</p>

<p class="para">Beneath the starlit sky cast by the projector, the mechanical lifeform quietly sorted through the relics of humanity it had collected.
    <br>Among them was a component once used for communication—
    <br>And as it interfaced with the projector, it triggered something unexpected.
    <br>A message, sprawling across the dome-shaped ceiling, bloomed into view.
    <br>It was a signal from far, far away—from the depths of space.
    <br>A code that would never fade—
    <br>A trail of footprints, leading toward the day they would meet again.</p>
