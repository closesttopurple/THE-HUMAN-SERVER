<p class="line"></p>
<p class="para"><i>It was a place known as the <i>Forest of Myth—</i></p>
<p class="para">Without warning, the trees nestled in the mountain valley began to sway violently.</p>
<p class="para">A sudden tremor shook the earth, the ground swelling and rising as if writhing. Trees long rooted in the soil groaned, toppled, and startled birds burst into flight all at once.
    <br>The ground split open, and from the fissure, a massive white form surged upward, piercing toward the sky.</p>
<p class="para">It was a towering white tower—no, a giant flower bud.</p>
<p class="para">As the trembling of the earth settled and the forest regained its stillness, the bud slowly began to unfurl.
    <br>Its delicate movement was just like the ceaseless, ancient rhythm of nature that plants have repeated since time immemorial.
    <br>White petals gently opened, gleaming with a dewy radiance, as if basking in the blessing of the sun—or perhaps seeking forgiveness from the heavens.</p>
<p class="para">A massive flower now stood upon the earth.
    <br>At the tip of the pistil rising from its center, there stood a boy.</p>
<p class="para">That boy—Nier—was being embraced from behind by a woman.</p>
<p class="para">Slowly, he opened his eyes.
    <br>He knew who held him. A comrade who once fought beside him—the wielder of twin blades, Kainé.
    <br>Her voice had been his guide, leading him here.</p>
<p class="para">“…Let’s go home.”</p>
<p class="para">It was a low, quiet voice he knew well.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">The village he hadn’t seen in so long was unchanged.
    <br>Still the same humble, peaceful rural town.
    <br>Its people continued their lives with quiet determination.</p>
<p class="para">An old water wheel set in the narrow river running through the center of the village still turned, casting up a clear spray of water.
    <br>In the marketplace lined with stone buildings, merchants chatted busily with familiar customers.
Children ran freely through the square with the small fountain, laughter echoing under the sky.</p>
<p class="para">On the slope of a gently rising hill stood an old stone house.
    <br>That was Nier’s home.</p>
<p class="para">In the garden, a rainbow of lunar tears were blooming in full glory—just a bit different from how he remembered it.
    <br>Their petals swaying in the breeze, the flowers were clearly well cared for, flourishing as if showing off their beauty.</p>
<p class="para">Red, yellow, blue, orange, pink, and white.
    <br>Butterflies danced among them.</p>
<p class="para">Amid the colorful lunar tears that seemed to cry out, look at me, stood a young girl watering them.
    <br>Humming a tune, as if speaking with the flowers, she poured both water and love on them with gentle care.
    <br>The soft sunlight caught in her long, white hair and the water flowing from the watering can, making everything shimmer brilliantly.</p>
<p class="para">She looked like a mother cherishing her child.
    <br>The sight was like a painting—so beautiful he wanted to hold it in his heart forever.
    <br>Nier hesitated to speak.
    <br>Perhaps sensing his gaze, the girl lifted her head while still watering.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother?”</p>
<p class="para">She stood frozen, eyes wide.
    <br>Even as the watering-can emptied, she didn’t move—her face like someone who’d just remembered something precious they’d long forgotten.</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, as if a string had snapped, she dropped the can and rushed into Nier’s arms.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother!”</p>
<p class="para">Startled by her movement, the butterflies took flight from the flowerbed.
    <br>Nier caught Yonah in his arms.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother…! Is it really you?”</p>
<p class="para">Nier said nothing, only held her close, taking in her warmth.
    <br>She looked far more grown up than the Yonah in his memories.
    <br>It wasn’t quite the Yonah he remembered, and it left him a little flustered.
    <br>How many years had passed since they’d been separated?</p>
<p class="para">“How did you get back, Brother?”
    <br>“Kainé called me. And… well…”</p>
<p class="para">He couldn’t put it into words, but deep in his chest, there was a quiet warmth.
    <br>Something he’d been trying to remember. Someone who helped him recall. What was it…?</p>
<p class="para">The butterflies that had flown off now returned to the flowerbed, settling gently on the blooms as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="para">“We have to celebrate! And we’ve got two guests too!”</p>
<p class="para">How Nier had come back didn’t seem all that important to Yonah.
    <br>She let go of his arms and beamed at the two standing behind him.</p>
<p class="para">“Took a lot of work to drag him all the way back here, you know.”
    <br>“Wow, a party!? I’m so happy!”</p>
<p class="para">It was Kainé and Emil.
    <br>The companions who had led Nier back to this world.
    <br>Since he awoke, they had been with him. Comrades who once fought by his side.</p>
<p class="para">“Okay, leave it to me! I’ll whip something up right away!”</p>
<p class="para">She was already heading for the kitchen, practically bouncing with excitement.</p>
<p class="para">“Wait—no, hang on, that’s—”</p>
<p class="para">Startled, Nier called out to stop her.</p>
<p class="para">He remembered Yonah’s cooking. The taste of… <i>that</i>, and <i>that other thing</i>—it all came rushing back to him.</p>
<p class="para">Yonah turned around with a wry smile, hands on her hips.</p>
<p class="para">“Geez. I’m not the same Yonah you remember. I’ve been training hard these past three years, you know?”</p>
<p class="para">Three years.
    <br>That was how much time had passed since Nier defeated the Shadowlord to get Yonah back—and then vanished.</p>
<p class="para">“Um, I’ll help too!”</p>
<p class="para">As Nier struggled to find words while reflecting on the lost years, Emil dashed past him and joined Yonah inside.
    <br>From the open door came the cheerful sounds of their conversation.
    <br>When had those two gotten so close…?
    <br>Nier thought he’d ask Yonah later about everything that had happened during these three years.</p>
<p class="para">And about what comes next.
    <br>They had time now—enough time for that.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Pomf</i>, a light pat on his shoulder from behind.
    <br>It was Kainé.</p>
<p class="para">“You made it back.”</p>
<p class="para">Nier gave a silent nod.
    <br>Then, with Kainé, he stepped inside the house he hadn’t seen in so long.</p>
<p class="para">There was Yonah, smiling and laughing among Emil and Kainé—his precious companions.
    <br>This was the happiness he’d dreamed of.</p>
<p class="para">But Nier also knew what lay ahead.
    <br>Hardships. Trials. And eventually, the end of the world…</p>
<p class="para">“Welcome home, Brother!”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah’s eyes sparkled with light as she waved from the back of the room.
    <br>Nier looked at her—that light—and thought:</p>
<p class="para">There’s no such thing as a world without pain.</p>
<p class="para">Even so, he wanted to live on—in this place, with the people he loved.</p>
<p class="para">“…I’m home, Yonah.”</p>
