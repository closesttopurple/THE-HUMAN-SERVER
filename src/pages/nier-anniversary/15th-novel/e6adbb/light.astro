<p class="title">Chapter 6 - Record of Transmigration</p>
<p class="para">“Happy birthday, Yonah.”</p>
<p class="para">Her older brother, Nier, and his little sister, Yonah, sat across from each other at a small table.
    <br>On it sat a modest but charming cake, decorated with fresh fruit. Today marked Yonah’s fifteenth birthday. In a quiet corner of their humble home, the siblings celebrated this special day together.</p>
<p class="para">Special. Yes, special.</p>
<p class="para">Yonah was frail, afflicted with an incurable illness. For fifteen uncertain years, they had clung to life hand in hand, surviving in this small village.</p>
<p class="para">Humming a cheerful tune, Yonah brought a bite of cake to her mouth. She still looked so innocent for a fifteen-year-old—but that was part of her charm.</p>
<p class="para">“Eating cake with a pretty hair ornament in… I really feel like a princess today. Maybe the dream I had came true.”</p>
<p class="para">“A dream?”</p>
<p class="para">“I dreamt we lived together in a big castle, you and me. There was a strange garden full of little birds… Doesn’t that sound just like a princess’s life?”</p>
<p class="para">Nier paused, his fork hovering above his cake.</p>
<p class="para">He wondered if Yonah had dreamt of the “Shadowlord’s castle.” Perhaps, unconsciously, she was beginning to recall what had once been forgotten. And yet—what lay beyond those memories was something she was better off never knowing.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah, maybe it’s time you got some rest.”</p>
<p class="para">Nier rose from his seat.</p>
<p class="para">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah tilted her head, fork still in her mouth.</p>
<p class="para">“You got a bit too excited today. We don’t want you to fall ill.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m fine, Brother. I’ve been feeling a lot better lately.”</p>
<p class="para">“I aired out your pillow this morning. Should be extra fluffy and comfy now.”</p>
<p class="para">With gentle hands, Nier helped her to her feet. The fork slipped from her grasp and clattered into the half-eaten cake with a hollow chime.</p>
<p class="para">—Once, Yonah had been taken by the Shadowlord.</p>
<p class="para">Each time she seemed close to remembering, Nier would find some way to gently steer her away from it.</p>
<p class="para">He hated the Shadowlord with every fiber of his being—so much it felt like it would burn him alive. But with the help of Kainé, Emil, and a strange talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he had finally defeated the Shadowlord and rescued Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">He had since lost contact with all those companions, scattered in the wake of that battle. The ache of their absence still lingered—but he had Yonah. She was here. That was enough.</p>
<p class="para">If he thought about the price the world had paid for that, the happiness he now held seemed almost terrifying.</p>
<p class="para">—So Yonah didn’t need to remember anything at all.</p>
<p class="para">Even after laying her in bed, Nier watched over her for a while. Soon, the sounds of a commotion reached them from beyond the window—loud enough to rouse even Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">Peering outside, Nier saw villagers gathered and buzzing with excitement. What had happened?
    <br>Curious, the two decided to go see for themselves.</p>
<p class="para">“Devola and Popola are back at the library!”</p>
<p class="para">Just outside the gate, a young villager shared the news.</p>
<p class="para">“What?!”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah gasped in disbelief and joy, both hands flying to cover her mouth.</p>
<p class="para">Devola and Popola were twin sisters who served as the village’s priestesses—and, in truth, its de facto leaders. They had vanished without a trace three years ago.</p>
<p class="para">More than just a spiritual blow to the villagers, their absence meant no children had been born since. Without them, the village had no future. Their sudden return today was nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p class="para">Gripping Nier’s hand, Yonah tugged at him urgently. She wanted to see them—those two who had once helped raise her and her brother, who had stood by them when they had no one else.</p>
<p class="para">But then Yonah noticed something—Nier’s eyes had gone dark.</p>
<p class="para">“What’s wrong, Brother?”</p>
<p class="para">Nier opened his mouth to respond—just as something came tumbling down the hill toward them.</p>
<p class="para">It stopped at their feet.</p>
<p class="para">A severed human head, its face frozen in a smile.</p>
<p class="para">“...Huh?”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah’s voice came out dazed and confused. Nier pulled her protectively into his arms.</p>
<p class="para">He turned—and saw that the young man they had just spoken with lay dead on the ground. No cry, no struggle—he had been killed in an instant.</p>
<p class="para">Killed.</p>
<p class="para">And beside his lifeless body now stood a pair of red-haired women: Devola and Popola, returned to the village after three long years. Their bodies were drenched in a red darker than their hair.</p>
<p class="para">“Nier. You know why we’re here, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="para">Devola’s voice cut through the haze. And though shaken, Nier understood all too well.</p>
<p class="para">But there was no reason Yonah needed to know.</p>
<p class="para">“They’re not the Devola and Popola you remember.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah nodded, her voice caught in her throat. The Devola and Popola she knew were gentle and kind. That made it all the harder to comprehend.</p>
<p class="para">Nier scooped her into his arms and ran.</p>
<p class="para">But no matter where they turned, the twins were there.</p>
<p class="para">No, not just there—they were everywhere. They weren’t just appearing—they were multiplying, like a mirage coming to life. Identical women with the same faces, spreading slaughter throughout the village.</p>
<p class="para">“Why…?” Yonah whimpered again and again, voice trembling.</p>
<p class="para">Why were Devola and Popola, who had always been so kind, doing this? Why were there so many of them?</p>
<p class="para">Nier had no answer—only “It’s going to be okay,” over and over, as he ran.</p>
<p class="para">The clear stream that ran through the village now flowed red with blood. Chickens pecked curiously at corpses that lay smiling and still. There was no one left to save.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, Nier and Yonah managed to evade pursuit and flee through the village gates.</p>
<p class="para">What awaited them beyond was a vast field, stained to the horizon with human blood</p>
<p class="para">It was a scene that could only be described in one way:</p>
<p class="para">The end of the world.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">A month passed.</p>
<p class="para">Nier and Yonah continued their quiet wandering, hiding from the world as they drifted from place to place—through silent forests, through forgotten undergrounds. Since leaving the village, they hadn’t seen a single soul. But the corpses of slaughtered people—they had seen those, again and again. Even here, in this place known as the “Forest of Myth,” it was no different. Surely,
    <br>Devola and Popola had appeared all over the world and killed everyone.</p>
<p class="para">Yonah gave a weak cough. Lately, her condition had seemed stable, but now it was worsening again.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah, let’s rest a bit.”</p>
<p class="para">They stepped into a nearby house, and Nier sat her down in a chair. Her coughs seemed harsh—sitting up would probably be easier than lying down.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s okay, Yonah. I’m here.”</p>
<p class="para">Her skin was cold. Nier pulled her into an embrace, pressing his forehead to hers to warm her up. And like that, the two stayed close for a long while, huddled together in silence.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother… Look, over there.”</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, Yonah caught a flicker of light in the corner of her eye. A strange glow leaked from a gap in the floorboards. When Nier pried them open, he found a ladder descending into the space below. A light was on underground.</p>
<p class="para">They decided to go down together. If there was anyone else left alive besides them, they had to meet them. They couldn’t let the chance pass.</p>
<p class="para">The ladder was cold under their hands. They descended carefully, and at the bottom—what they saw left them speechless.</p>
<p class="para">Candle lined the walls at even intervals, bathing the stone chamber in the color of twilight. It was spacious, white, and built of stone.</p>
<p class="para">And then—angels.</p>
<p class="para">A forest of statues modeled after angels stretched out before them, each and every one holding a clear vessel to its breast. Inside those vessels was a transparent fluid—and a human infant.
    <br>No, smaller even than a newborn child.</p>
<p class="para">“…What is this?”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah clutched her chest with both hands as if to tear through her fear.</p>
<p class="para">The babies did not move. Their bodies were clean, almost pristine—but the veins visible beneath their skin were discolored and cloudy.</p>
<p class="para">Why were there so many infants here?</p>
<p class="para">Why? For what purpose?</p>
<p class="para">“This is… a Replicant factory.”</p>
<p class="para">The words scraped out of Yonah’s dry throat.</p>
<p class="para">Words she shouldn’t have known. And yet, they came.</p>
<p class="para">Her head throbbed. It hurt—so much it felt like it would burst. She staggered back, but Nier caught her.</p>
<p class="para">“Project Gestalt, the Shadowlord, Androids… Replicants…”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah muttered disjointed words through half-parted lips, as if possessed.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah… Yonah!”</p>
<p class="para">Nier called her name, trying to bring her back.</p>
<p class="para">But he already knew what was happening to her.</p>
<p class="para">Yonah was remembering.</p>
<p class="para">The memories that had been missing—explained away by Nier as “a long sleep.” The time she spent living with the Shadowlord. The time when another Yonah had inhabited her body.</p>
<p class="para">And now, those memories were returning—along with everything they had once known.</p>
<p class="para">A distant, distant past.</p>
<p class="para">A thousand years ago.</p>
<p class="para">Humanity had stood on the brink of extinction due to a deadly disease.</p>
<p class="para">To save itself, it launched “Project Gestalt.” It extracted the soul—or <i>Gestalt</i>—from the human body for safekeeping, with the goal of one day restoring it when the world became safe again. To do that, they created empty vessels in human form.</p>
<p class="para">Those vessels were called <i>Replicants</i>.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah… we’re not human. We were just made here…”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah looked around with frightened eyes. The babies in jars, clutched by angels—mockeries of life.</p>
<p class="para">Nier, too. Yonah, too. Everyone in the world was just a <i>vessel</i>, created here.</p>
<p class="para">“…It’s okay, Yonah. We’re still human.”</p>
<p class="para">Nier spoke gently.</p>
<p class="para">Maybe they were created as vessels. Maybe they were empty.</p>
<p class="para">But the Replicants, over time, had begun to reject the merging with their Gestalts. They had developed souls of their own.</p>
<p class="para">And the Gestalts—souls with no place left to return to.</p>
<p class="para">Their king… the Shadowlord.</p>
<p class="para">He wanted to take back his sister’s body.</p>
<p class="para">His sister’s name was Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">That’s why the Shadowlord took her. Because she was the vessel meant for his sister’s soul.</p>
<p class="para">Which meant—</p>
<p class="para">But none of that mattered to Nier.</p>
<p class="para">“We are who we are. Living, breathing people.”</p>
<p class="para">Even if he was only the vessel for the Shadowlord.</p>
<p class="para">“I just… wanted to get Yonah back.”</p>
<p class="para">That’s why he killed the Shadowlord.</p>
<p class="para">And by doing so, he sealed humanity’s fate. With the Shadowlord gone, the Gestalts could no longer survive. There was no way left to revive humankind.</p>
<p class="para">All that remained was ruin.</p>
<p class="para">And maybe, just maybe, the androids like Devola and Popola—the ones who had overseen the project—might continue to exist.</p>
<p class="para">“If there’s no use for Replicants anymore… That’s why Devola and Popola are killing everyone…”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah trailed off and slowly turned her gaze to Nier.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother… did you know all of this?”</p>
<p class="para">Nier didn’t know what kind of face to make. He just nodded. Yes, he knew.</p>
<p class="para">Three years ago, when he had stormed the Shadowlord’s castle to save Yonah, he had met Devola and Popola and heard the truth.</p>
<p class="para">He had known that killing the Shadowlord meant destroying humanity’s last hope.</p>
<p class="para">And still—he chose to protect Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">“…It’s all my fault, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah’s beautiful face twisted in pain.</p>
<p class="para">Crushed by guilt, regret, and the weight of her brother’s love.</p>
<p class="para">“No.”</p>
<p class="para">“If I hadn’t been around… you wouldn’t have had to do all this.”</p>
<p class="para">Nier pulled her into his arms. He hadn’t saved her just to hear those words.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah. A world without you in it…”</p>
<p class="para">His voice broke. He couldn’t say more. He didn’t know what words would keep from hurting her even more.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s okay, Brother.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah reached out and gently ran her fingers through her brother’s bowed hair.</p>
<p class="para">“As long as you’re here, I’m not sad at all.”</p>
<p class="para">Nier couldn’t bring himself to look at her face. He was afraid—afraid that if he did, he’d see whether she truly meant it… or was only trying to comfort him.</p>
<p class="para">And so, in silence, he simply held her close, clinging to the warmth of her small body.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">No matter what truth they uncovered, they had to keep moving forward.
    <br>Nier and Yonah wandered the underground depths, searching for any sign of life.</p>
<p class="para">Hand in hand, they walked deeper into the subterranean space—toward the sound they’d heard.
    <br>They arrived at a place completely bare. No statues of angels stood here.
    <br>The far wall was made of glass, and beyond it stretched a sheer cliff, overlooking a massive pit.</p>
<p class="para">The dark hole was filled with junk.
    <br>Heads, arms, legs. Women’s torsos. And red hair.
    <br>Heaps of Devolas and Popolas—countless twin androids—were discarded without care.
    <br>As Nier and Yonah stared in stunned silence, a mechanical grinding noise echoed. A robot with massive arms descended from above and crushed the remains under its weight.
    <br>Scraps, fragments, dust—what had once been androids scattered in the darkness, catching what little light there was.</p>
<p class="para">“This is the fate of androids who committed sin.”</p>
<p class="para">A voice spoke from behind them.
    <br>Nier and Yonah turned. Popola stood there—alone.</p>
<p class="para">“We were administrators of Project Gestalt. But you know that already, don’t you, Nier? During our fight… a certain pair of Devola and Popola went berserk. They failed in their duty to manage the project.”</p>
<p class="para">When Nier and his companions stormed the Shadowlord’s Castle, the ones who stood in their way were Devola and Popola—caretakers of the village who had helped them countless times.
    <br>When Devola was killed in that battle, the remaining Popola lost control, driven by rage.</p>
<p class="para">That’s why every model of Devola and Popola was ordered to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="para">“Our final role is to eliminate the remaining Replicants.”</p>
<p class="para">Nier reached for the sword on his back. With a glance, he told Yonah to run.</p>
<p class="para">“…I’m sorry, Popola. But I’m not like you.”</p>
<p class="para">Drawing the sword behind him, Nier stepped forward.
    <br>In that instant, both of them closed the distance in a blur.
    <br>Their weapons clashed—Popola’s staff made a cold, ringing sound as it parried Nier’s strike, tracing an arc through the air</p>
<p class="para">How did it come to this? Nier wondered.</p>
<p class="para">They weren’t just vessels for Gestalts.
    <br>They were human—beings with hearts.
    <br>He only wanted to prove something so simple: that when someone takes away what you hold dear, you can’t just feel nothing.
    <br>That’s all.
    <br>And the result had been a mountain of corpses in the village.
    <br>Still—if remaining sinless meant losing Yonah, then he could never regret the sins he’d committed.
    <br>What else could he have done?</p>
<p class="para">Dodging Nier’s attacks with graceful steps, Popola began to sing.
    <br>A song—or rather, a magical chant.</p>
<p class="para">Spikes of energy erupted from the ground.
    <br>Nier knew this was bad.
    <br>If Popola still had access to magic, he couldn’t both fight and protect Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah!”</p>
<p class="para">He had to take her and run.
    <br>As Nier turned his head, searching for her, a spear of magical energy came into view—right before his eyes.</p>
<p class="para">His vision was suddenly bathed in red.
    <br>But there was no pain.</p>
<p class="para">Yonah’s body collapsed gently into his arms, her heart pierced.
    <br>Her blood-drenched eyes softened, and she gave a faint smile.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry… Brother… I… love you…”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah. Yonah. Yonah.
    <br>Nier screamed her name again and again.
    <br>But she never opened her eyes again.</p>
<p class="para">Holding her bloodstained body to his cheek, his shoulders shook.
    <br>But he didn’t know how to cry.
    <br>All the emotions swirling within him—only one stood out clearly: hatred.</p>
<p class="para">He raised his blood-smeared face and glared at Popola, eyes blazing red.</p>
<p class="para">Still cradling Yonah in one arm, Nier leveled his sword at her.</p>
<p class="para">“You know it, don’t you, Nier?
    <br>Yonah didn’t die because she was trying to protect you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Shut up!” Nier roared.
    <br>He didn’t need her to say it—he already knew.
    <br>So please, don’t say it.</p>
<p class="para">But Popola continued, mercilessly.</p>
<p class="para">“She chose death on her own.”</p>
<p class="para">—It’s all my fault, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="para">He remembered Yonah’s voice when she said that.
    <br>He’d been too afraid to look at her face then, because deep down, he knew.
    <br>He knew she was suffering.</p>
<p class="para">And now, she lay peacefully, smiling in death as if released from that pain.</p>
<p class="para">…It was my fault. I killed her.
    <br>I crushed Yonah under the weight of her own guilt.</p>
<p class="para">That thought made him laugh.</p>
<p class="para">Popola’s magic bullets rained down on Nier’s body.
    <br>Still, he didn’t care that his flesh was torn.
    <br>He launched forward, closing the distance in a straight line.
    <br>And with a flash like light itself, his sword thrust forward—piercing straight through Popola’s chest.</p>
<p class="para">“…Maybe you were the real Shadowlord after all.”</p>
<p class="para">Her words echoed in the silence.
    <br>Then Nier swung the sword—with her still impaled—and slammed it into the glass wall.
    <br>Shards exploded, and Popola fell into the great pit below.
    <br>To join the countless other remains of Devola and Popola that slumbered there.
    <br>A mechanical noise whirred to life.
    <br>Another arm descended and crushed her with a sickening crunch.</p>
<p class="para">And at last, the world returned to just the two of them.</p>
<p class="para">Nier held Yonah’s lifeless body close, unable to part with her.
    <br>Her body still warm, memories began to flood into him.
    <br>The soft voice that called “Brother,” over and over.
    <br>Her smile.
    <br>The nights when coughing kept her from sleep, and they held hands until she drifted off. That warmth.
    <br>Her clumsy cooking—even that was enough.</p>
<p class="para">Yonah was gone.
    <br>There was nothing left.
    <br>Not even a reason for the world’s end remained.</p>
<p class="para">＊</p>
<p class="para">—The Castle of the Shadowlord.
    <br> A quiet room where thick curtains sway. Beside the window sits a small bed.
    <br> This is where the Shadowlord once lived together with his sister.</p>
<p class="para">Nier stood there, alone, holding Yonah’s lifeless body.
    <br>Alone. Truly alone now.
    <br>There was no sign of people, nor of androids, anywhere.
    <br>Perhaps Devola and Popola had wanted to show him this ruined world—this proof of sin.
    <br>That was why, until the end, they let him live. That’s what Nier thought.</p>
<p class="para">Slowly, he took a step forward and laid Yonah down upon the bed.
    <br>A cold wind was blowing. When he grasped the fluttering curtain, dazzling light poured into the dim room.
    <br>Outside, ash-like snow was falling.</p>
<p class="para">He remembered.
    <br>How the Shadowlord’s sister had chosen death here.
    <br>How she opened the curtain before his eyes and vanished into the light…</p>
<p class="para">A normal boy who wanted power, just to protect his little sister.
    <br>He fought alone for over a thousand years and eventually became the Shadowlord.
    <br>He was simply searching for a way to save her.
    <br>So he took the vessel for his sister—he stole Yonah from Nier, and gave her body to his own sister.
    <br>But she had had enough.
    <br>She didn’t want to go on living if it meant stealing someone else’s body. And so—</p>
<p class="para">—Sorry… Brother… I… love… you…</p>
<p class="para">The Shadowlord’s sister. Yonah.
    <br>My sister.
    <br>That gentle girl—maybe she never wanted to live at the cost of someone else’s sacrifice.
    <br>All I wanted was to protect her.
    <br>Was that a mistake?</p>
<p class="para">In the end, maybe I was the same as the Shadowlord.
    <br>The very man I thought I hated so deeply.</p>
<p class="para">Nier closed his eyes.
    <br>The light shining upon this world without Yonah felt unpleasant to him.
    <br>And soon, even the faint light that remained behind his eyelids gradually faded—</p>
<p class="para">The light was extinguished.</p>
