<p class="para">2053, Summer.
    <br>In Shinjuku, salt snow fell.
    <br>White silently piled up, covering the blackened buildings.</p>
<p class="para">In one corner of Shinjuku, there was a supermarket that had turned into a ruin.
    <br>Once, it must have had a wide entrance with many customers coming and going.</p>
<p class="para">──<i>Gosha!</i></p>
<p class="para">A sound like a lump of flesh striking something dull echoed.</p>
<p class="para"><i>“Hah… hah…”</i></p>
<p class="para">A boy, holding a steel pipe, breathed heavily, his shoulders rising and falling.
    <br>At his feet, a black creature—a <i>“Shade”</i>—was lying in a pool of blood.
    The boy had killed them all, frantically, as they had appeared from nowhere to attack.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah…”</p>
<p class="para">The boy hurried deeper into the supermarket.
    <br>He reached a door marked “office” and opened the fragile-looking door.</p>
<p class="para"><i>“Yonah…?”</i></p>
<p class="para">In the shadow of the room, a small girl was hiding.
    <br>The boy’s younger sister—<i>Yonah.</i></p>
<p class="para">“Brother! I’m… okay—”</p>
<p class="para">Before she could finish, Yonah started coughing violently. She had been ill.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you alright!?”</p>
<p class="para">The boy quickly sat Yonah down on a nearby metal chair and rubbed her back.</p>
<p class="para">Covering her mouth with her small hand, Yonah looked up at her brother, her face filled with unease.</p>
<p class="para">“I'm sorry… If you hear me coughing, will the <i>black ghost</i> come again?”</p>
<p class="para">To reassure his worried sister, the boy rubbed her back even harder than before.</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t worry, Brother won’t lose to any ghost.”</p>
<p class="para">That’s right. He would kill them all.
    <br>Everything that caused Yonah pain.</p>
<p class="para">Then, something caught his eye beside the chair.</p>
<p class="para"><i>──A book.</i>
    <br>On its black cover was what looked like a face.
    <br>It was an eerie, old book.
    <br>His instincts screamed at him: <i>Don’t touch it.</i>
    <br>If he touched it,
    <br>It felt like he’d make another mistake.</p>
<p class="para">“Yonah and I will always be together, right?”</p>
<p class="para">At Yonah’s voice, the boy snapped out of his thoughts.</p>
<p class="para">There was something he needed to do now. <i>They had to find a safe place.</i></p>
<p class="para">“Yonah, let’s get out of here. More and more <i>Shades</i> are going to gather.”
    <br>“Okay, I’ll follow you, Brother.”</p>
<p class="para">They quietly left the office.</p>
<p class="para">The inside of the supermarket was dark and eerie, with no electricity. Near the entrance, a <i>Shade</i>—the <i>black ghost</i>—blocked the way. Going through there looked dangerous.</p>
<p class="para">Supporting his coughing sister, the boy scanned the dark room for another way out.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother, over there.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah whispered softly, pointing to a corner of debris.
    <br>A thin beam of light from outside filtered through.</p>
<p class="para">“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p class="para">The boy moved the rubble away, revealing a hole in the building. It seemed to lead outside.</p>
<p class="para">“We can get out from here.”</p>
<p class="para">The boy smiled at Yonah, and her face lit up.
    <br>It wasn’t just the fact they could escape, but the joy of being able to help her brother, even in some small way.</p>
<p class="para">“You go first. But you have to wait right outside.”
    <br>“Got it!”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah stepped up to the hole and began to crawl through.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother, it’s fine. The ghosts aren’t here.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah, now outside, whispered back.
    <br>The boy was about to follow, when—</p>
<p class="para">“Let me give you some strength.”</p>
<p class="para">A low voice echoed from behind him.
    <br>Turning around, the boy saw the black book from earlier, now lying near him.
    <br><i>Why?</i></p>
<p class="para"><i>“In exchange for your…</i>
    <br><i>I’ll give you the power to protect…”</i></p>
<p class="para">The voice seemed to come from the book itself.</p>
<p class="para"><i>I can’t make another mistake,</i></p>
<p class="para">he thought. <i>I can’t.</i>
    <br>The boy muttered.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t need power. I’ll live with my own strength, with Yonah.”</p>
<p class="para">The book said no more.
    <br>The boy pushed his body through the gap in the rubble.</p>
<p class="title"><i>Later</i></p>
<p class="para">“Brother, where should we go now?”</p>
<p class="para">Behind the supermarket, there was no sign of any <i>Shades</i>, not even any people.
    <br>Perhaps no one lived in Shinjuku anymore. Years had passed since the evacuation orders were given for Tokyo.</p>
<p class="para">“Well…”</p>
<p class="para">He had no destination in mind.
    <br>The boy and Yonah were orphans.</p>
<p class="para">“…I think I want to go south.”,
    <br>Yonah said quietly.
    <br>“They say it’s warmer there.”</p>
<p class="para">The boy blinked in surprise at his little sister’s words.
    <br>Even if they went a little south in Tokyo, the temperature wouldn’t rise much. Was it knowledge she’d gained from a picture book?</p>
<p class="para">—But perhaps, there was light there.</p>
<p class="para">The two decided to head south.
    <br>They chose a large road through the desolate city, thinking it would be easier to notice if any <i>Shades</i> appeared, and it would be easier to ask for help if they encountered anyone.</p>
<p class="para">Supporting his coughing sister, the boy walked, stepping through the snow that was like salt.</p>
<p class="para">Please, let us find something to eat.
    <br>Please, let there be a safe place somewhere.
    <br>Please, let Yonah’s cough get better…
    <br>Just as Yonah had no one else to rely on, the boy lived only to protect her.
    <br>It wasn’t a burden, but a fact that made his heart stronger.</p>
<p class="para">They relied on the traffic signs along the road, walking south.
    <br>The boy read aloud a sign that had been bent at an angle.</p>
<p class="para">“They say this is Meiji Street.”
    <br>“They say this is Meiji Street.”
    <br>“If we walk down Meiji Street, will we get there? Um… Hawaii?”
    <br>“Hawaii!?”</p>
<p class="para">At Yonah’s unexpected words, the boy couldn’t help but laugh.
    <br>She must have read about it in a picture book.
    <br>The boy recalled the shelter they had stayed at, a community center where they had lived as orphans. Did they have such a book there?</p>
<p class="para">“Hawaii has a great king. I wonder what kind of person he is, Brother.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah’s innocent words caused the tension in his heart to loosen.
    <br>Her childish ignorance felt unbearably endearing.</p>
<p class="para">“Yeah. I bet it’s a place without snow, a warm place.”</p>
<p class="para">“Mm-hmm. Yonah doesn’t really like snow.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah said this and began singing a tune she barely remembered.
    <br>It was a light melody, like something from a southern island.</p>
<p class="para">Three hours passed.
    <br>They had walked slowly, with Yonah coughing often.
    <br>The snow piled up, and they hadn’t moved very far.
    <br>By the time the sun set, they arrived at a large five-way intersection.</p>
<p class="para">Flashing neon lights.
    <br>Digital signage flickered on and off.
    <br>Massive advertisements on decaying fashion buildings.
    <br>Street lamps.
    <br>Fluorescent lights illuminated an empty large train station.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s shining…”</p>
<p class="para">There was light.
    <br>For some reason, this area still had electricity, though unstable.
    <br>The two of them stood still in the center of the empty intersection.</p>
<p class="para">Just having light in the dark made their frozen hearts feel a little warmer.
    <br>Yonah, though coughing, seemed mesmerized by the garish lights.</p>
<p class="para">“Brother.”</p>
<p class="para">“Hm?”</p>
<p class="para">“Look, the snow. It’s so pretty.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah pointed to the sky.
    <br>The snow still fell, but now it sparkled, glowing under the lights.
    <br>The boy couldn’t help but gaze up at it too, captivated by the beauty of the snow.</p>
<p class="para">“Yeah, it really is.”
    <br>“I think I might like snow a little more now.”</p>
<p class="para">Yonah said this and jumped, trying to catch the falling snow, coughing as she did.
    <br>She tried her best, despite her condition.</p>
<p class="para">──Would they ever reach somewhere?
    <br>Or would they die tomorrow?</p>
<p class="para">Still, the two of them were here, now, together.
    <br>The happiness of the present, of being here now, was all they wished for.
    <br>They didn’t need anything more.</p>
<p class="para">The sparkling snow Yonah caught in her palm melted instantly and disappeared.</p>
