<p class="title">Chapter 3 - Garden of Flowers</p>
<p class="para">A blue, cloudless sky.
    <br>The soft rustle of the fountain. Birds chirp, and a pleasant breeze carries the scent of flowers. A garden so peaceful, it feels almost suspicious.</p>
<p class="para">When I regained consciousness, I was touching the antenna… Right, the boy had told me to touch it, and I obeyed.
    <br>Right beside me, the white-haired boy stands quietly.
    <br>Here in this garden, I’ve been traveling with him in search of my memories.</p>
<p class="para">“Welcome back,”
    ,br>the boy said, wearing a gentle smile.
    <br>“Did anything come back to you?”</p>
<p class="para">I slowly stood up.
    <br>Then I closed my eyes, as if searching the depths of my mind.
    <br>When I touched the antenna buried among the flowers, a memory had flowed into my mind.
    <br>It was a tale from a ruined, unfamiliar world.
    <br>An old robot, trying to protect some small robots. The warped method he chose—maybe even that had been a form of love.</p>
<p class="para">I remembered now—I too had once possessed that kind of feeling.
    <br>Yes, something I had truly loved, something I had wanted to protect with all my heart... that was...</p>
<p class="para">“…My sister.”</p>
<p class="para">I was surprised the word had come out of my mouth.
    <br>Sister.</p>
<p class="para">“I had… a sister I wanted to protect.”</p>
<p class="para">A faint image of a young girl formed in my mind.
    <br>Calling me “Brother, Brother,” always following behind me—at least, that’s how it seemed.
    <br>I turned those vague memory fragments over and over in my head.
    <br>Yes—I had a sister. Someone more important to me than myself. She was small… and frail…
    <br>Her name was Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">I still don’t know who I am.
    <br>But there’s one thing I now know for certain.
    <br>I have to return to Yonah.</p>
<p class="para">A warmth I hadn’t felt since waking in this world now lit a flame deep in my chest.</p>
<p class="para">“Yeah,”
    <br>the boy peered into my eyes.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re doing well. Let’s try to recover even more of your memories.”</p>
<p class="para">I have to remember.</p>
<p class="para">Where is Yonah? Is she safe? Why am I the only one here?</p>
<p class="para">The half-recovered memories only served to stir me up.</p>
<p class="para">My eyes darted all around, and before I knew it, my legs began to wander in search of another antenna.</p>
<p class="para">“Um—wait a second!”</p>
<p class="para">From behind me, the boy’s voice rang out, sounding slightly awkward.</p>
<p class="para">“What?”</p>
<p class="para">When I turned around with a slightly defiant feeling, the boy averted his gaze from me and pretended to be deeply interested in the distant fountain.</p>
<p class="para">"You don't have to be in such a rush. More importantly..."</p>
<p class="para">What on earth is he going on about? I need to hurry and find another antenna.</p>
<p class="para">"Sorry. I just thought... maybe I should’ve gotten you dressed first."</p>
<p class="para">"...Huh?"</p>
<p class="para">At the boy’s words, I looked down at my own body.
    <br>The white, veil-like garment that had been clinging to me just moments ago had vanished, leaving me completely naked.</p>
<p class="para">"Uwah—!"</p>
<p class="para">Instinctively, I wrapped my arms around myself and curled in on my body.
    <br>When did those clothes disappear?
    <br>No—come to think of it, maybe I was never wearing clothes to begin with. That’s right.
    <br>Ever since I awoke in the darkness, I’d been like this the whole time.</p>
<p class="para">And now, all of a sudden, I was overwhelmed by a sense of shame.
    <br>It was as if, along with my memories, I’d begun to recover my emotions as well.
    <br>When I looked over at the boy, he was, as usual, dressed in his indistinct, shapeless white clothing.</p>
<p class="para">"I’ll get you something to wear. Now then—
    <br>let’s see which one you’ll like."</p>
<p class="para"><i>Snap!</i></p>
<p class="para">With a soft giggle, the boy snapped his fingers.</p>
<p class="para">In the next instant, I found myself dressed in some strange outfit.
    <br>It had an exaggerated collar and was dyed in bold, primary red and yellow.
    <br>The pants were baggy and hard to move in.
    <br>To top it all off, I was wearing a bright red wig, and a red ball had been stuck onto my nose.</p>
<p class="para">"How about a clown costume?"</p>
<p class="para">"This is a little…"</p>
<p class="para">I mean, sure, I did need clothes right away, but I should be allowed a little input, shouldn’t I?</p>
<p class="para">"I see. Well then, how about this?"</p>
<p class="para"><i>Snap!</i></p>
<p class="para">This time, I was clad in a stiff, white suit that covered my entire body.
    <br>My face was surrounded by a dome-like cover.
    <br>And more than anything, it was <i>heavy</i>.
    <br>So heavy that I couldn’t take it—I crumpled forward, dropping to both hands and knees on the ground.</p>
<p class="para">"It's a suit for going into space. Super expensive, and really rare."</p>
<p class="para">"Space...? I don’t think I’m going there… probably."</p>
<p class="para"><i>Snap!</i></p>
<p class="para">"Then how about this one? It’s the kind of outfit worn by androids built for combat."</p>
<p class="para">The moment the boy snapped his fingers again, my vision was swallowed by darkness.</p>
<p class="para">"Uwah!"</p>
<p class="para">"What’s covering your eyes are black goggles. There’s a proper reason for wearing them and—"</p>
<p class="para">"I can’t see anything so <i>no thank you!</i>"</p>
<p class="para">I couldn’t help but shout. I’d had more than enough of the dark already.</p>
<p class="para">The boy seemed to be enjoying my reactions.</p>
<p class="para">"...Alright, enough messing around."</p>
<p class="para">I squeezed the words out, half-exasperated, and the boy made a show of thinking for a moment.</p>
<p class="para">"Then let’s go with something that suits <i>you</i>."</p>
<p class="para">Saying that, the boy snapped his fingers again.</p>
<p class="para"><i>Snap!</i></p>
<p class="para">A light, gray top. A black panel of cloth covering my torso down to below my waist. Loose-fitting, short trousers. Long boots. And to complete it, long gloves that reached above my elbows.</p>
<p class="para">"Yeah… this might be it."</p>
<p class="para">Wearing this gave me the strange feeling that the edges of my existence had come into clear focus.
    <br>Like, at last, the sense of myself had truly taken shape.</p>
<p class="para">"Yeah, it suits you."</p>
<p class="para">The boy nodded with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="para">"...Thanks."</p>
<p class="para">I took a deep breath and thanked him.
    <br>It felt like I’d been played with quite a bit, but I decided to let it slide.</p>
<p class="para">"Now then, since we’re all set—"</p>
<p class="para">The boy spread his arms in a theatrically grand gesture./p>
<p class="para">"Let’s go find the next memory, shall we?"</p>
<p class="para">I once again cast my gaze across the garden.</p>
<p class="para">A vast garden. At first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but once I knew to look for them, I realized antennas giving off an unnatural presence were hidden all throughout the place.</p>
<p class="para">Entwined with creeping vines.</p>
<p class="para">Buried in flower bed soil.</p>
<p class="para">Concealed behind tall hedges.</p>
<p class="para">And… at the base of a tree.</p>
<p class="para">My eyes landed on one antenna buried beneath a majestic tree draped in clusters of pale purple flowers.</p>
<p class="para">Somehow, I felt like it was calling out to me.</p>
<p class="para">I began to approach the antenna buried at the tree’s base.</p>
<p class="para">The moment my fingertips touched it—</p>
<p class="para">A torrent of letters exploded forth, wrapping around me again.</p>
<p class="para">A sensation like my consciousness and body were being peeled apart.</p>
<p class="para">I was sinking once more—</p>
<p class="para">into the world of words…</p>
