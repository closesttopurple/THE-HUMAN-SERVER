<p class="title">A trilogy of games with themes and symbols heavily reminiscent of Drakengard and NieR.</p>
<p class="para">The play order is <i>The Isle Dragon Roars</i>, <i>The Forsaken Maiden</i>, and then <i>The Beasts of Burden</i>.<br><br>Of all the entries in this category, this is the one I recommend the most. It should also be noted that the Demo of the first game has a different story.<br><br>Lastly, the community often refers to Yoko Taro saying "Voice of Cards is not a Drakengard game".<br><br>Of course it isn't, it's a Voice of Cards game ! NieR isn't a Drakengard game either.</p>
