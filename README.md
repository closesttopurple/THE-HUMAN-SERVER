Hiya! Karis here. This is a small scale website that will serve as the hub for all of my personal projects.
## Direction
My main project right now is The Human Server. I want it to be akin to a ‘library’ for content from the esteemed video game director, Yoko Taro.\
I will slowly add resources to learn more about his works over time.\
I want to add a section that catalogues all of the releases in the yokoverse, a section that gives you access to the hard to come by stories, a section that talks about recent news in regards to the yokoverse, and a list of events, past and present, fan or official, that are related.\
