Hiya! Karis here. This is a small scale website for my personal projects.\
Please don't look at my code. It's not built to be good it's built to be simple.

## Direction
My main project right now is The Human Server. I want it to be akin to a ‘library’ for written works from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Taro">Yoko Taro.<a>\
I will slowly add resources to learn more about his works over time. Feel free to submit anything you would like added ! You will receive credit.\
I also have *karisbooru*, a tag-based image hosting service that I use for personal uses, and Yoko Taro related image archival.

### How to contact me?
You can find my email and social media at https://closesttopurple.org. Social media would probably be easier. Just don't message me on steam... Why would you ?

### Plans For the Future
Transcribing NieR's novellas from my English copy of <i>Grimoire NieR Revised Edition</i> and making outlines for Yonah's Diary, Interviews, weapon stories, and the text adventures.\
Making outlines for NieR:Automata's novellas, orchestras, and other in-game content such as weapon stories, or messages.\
Making outlines for every story in NieR Re[in]carnation, such as the main story, character stories, EX stories, ROD stories, costume stories, and event stories... Yay ! So much damn work ! I'm jumping for joy !\
Finishing the SINoALICE section. Someday...\
Making a section dedicated to the various (far) lesser known Yoko Taro projects, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_Cards:_The_Isle_Dragon_Roars">Voice of Cards</a> series, Bakuken :(, Thou Shalt Not Die, and KamiErabi GOD.app. I wish Voice of Cards got some novellas.\
Converting every pdf into it's own page on the actual site.\
Making a guide for how to use the site, or my own guide akin to <a href="https://closesttopurple.org/sg">I AM CAIM's.</a>\
Adding different language options. It's just me working on this, so it would be very difficult for me to do this. I promise that it'll happen one day.

### Currently working on?
I'm currently working on converting everything into it's own page ! I mean <i>everything...</i> THIS IS SO MUCH WORK. Seriously, I have to meticulously copy and paste ! Okay, okay...\
I'm joking. It's more tedious than anything, but still rather annoying. Can you imagine how long it's going to take me to convert DOD3 Story Side into a page ? Yowza, if you will.

### Last Updated:
April 13th.

### Why do you space out your punctuation ? !
Come on, what's the point of this section ? You're only making yourself laugh !\
