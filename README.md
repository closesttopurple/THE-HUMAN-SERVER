Hiya! Karis here. This is a small scale website that will serve as the hub for all of my personal projects.

## Direction
My main project right now is The Human Server. I want it to be akin to a ‘library’ for content from the esteemed video game director, Yoko Taro.\
I will slowly add resources to learn more about his works over time. Feel free to submit anything you would like added ! You will receive credit.\
I also have *karisbooru*, a tag-based image hosting service that I use for personal uses, and Yoko Taro related image archival.

### How to contact me?
You can find my email and social media at https://closesttopurple.org. Social media would probably be easier.

### LAST UPDATED:
Early February or something. I only add when I'm motivated (not right now), or when someone asks.
